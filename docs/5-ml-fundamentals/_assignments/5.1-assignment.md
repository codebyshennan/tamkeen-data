2. What is feature engineering?
   _a. Creating new features from existing data_
   b. Collecting new data
   c. Training models
   d. Testing algorithms

**Explanation**: Feature engineering involves:
- Transforming raw data into useful features

- Improving model performance
Common techniques:
- Scaling and normalization
- One-hot encoding
- Binning/discretization
- Interaction features
- Polynomial features

3. What is the bias-variance tradeoff?
   _a. Balance between model complexity and generalization_
   b. Balance between training and testing data
   c. Balance between features and samples
   d. Balance between accuracy and speed

**Explanation**: The bias-variance tradeoff:
- Represents fundamental ML challenge
- Balances underfitting vs. overfitting
- Affects model generalization
- Guides model selection
Key concepts:
- High bias: Underfitting
- High variance: Overfitting
- Optimal balance depends on data
- Related to model complexity

4. What is cross-validation used for?
   _a. Assessing model performance on unseen data_
   b. Creating new features
   c. Cleaning data
   d. Selecting algorithms

**Explanation**: Cross-validation:
- Evaluates model generalization
- Provides robust performance estimates
- Helps detect overfitting
- Guides hyperparameter tuning
Implementation involves:
- Splitting data multiple times
- Training on different subsets
- Testing on held-out data
- Averaging performance metrics

5. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
   _a. Supervised uses labeled data, unsupervised doesn't_
   b. Supervised is faster than unsupervised
   c. Supervised uses more data than unsupervised
   d. Supervised is more accurate than unsupervised

**Explanation**: Key differences:
- Supervised Learning:
  * Uses labeled training data
  * Has defined target variable
  * Makes predictions
  * Examples: classification, regression
- Unsupervised Learning:
  * Uses unlabeled data
  * Finds hidden patterns
  * No target variable
  * Examples: clustering, dimensionality reduction
