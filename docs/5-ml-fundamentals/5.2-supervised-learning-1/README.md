# Supervised Learning - Part 1 🎓

Welcome to the first part of supervised learning! Here we'll explore fundamental algorithms that form the backbone of machine learning. Think of these algorithms as different tools in your ML toolkit - each with its own strengths and ideal use cases.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

1. Understand and implement Naive Bayes classifiers for text classification
2. Master k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) for both classification and regression tasks
3. Apply Support Vector Machines (SVM) for complex decision boundaries
4. Build and interpret Decision Trees for transparent decision-making
5. Choose the optimal algorithm for different problem types

## Algorithm Overview 🔍

### 1. [Naive Bayes](./naive-bayes.md) 📊
Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem:

$$P(y|X) = \frac{P(X|y)P(y)}{P(X)}$$

Perfect for:
- Text classification (spam detection, sentiment analysis)
- High-dimensional data
- Real-time prediction needs
- When independence assumption holds

### 2. [k-Nearest Neighbors](./knn.md) 🎯
Instance-based learning using distance metrics:

$$\text{distance}(p,q) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (p_i - q_i)^2}$$

Ideal for:
- Recommendation systems
- Pattern recognition
- Anomaly detection
- When data is well-clustered

### 3. [Support Vector Machines](./svm.md) ⚔️
Finds optimal hyperplane with maximum margin:

$$\min_{w,b} \frac{1}{2}||w||^2 \text{ subject to } y_i(w^Tx_i + b) \geq 1$$

Best for:
- Complex classification tasks
- Non-linear decision boundaries
- High-dimensional spaces
- When clear margin of separation exists

### 4. [Decision Trees](./decision-trees.md) 🌳
Hierarchical decisions using information theory:

$$\text{Information Gain} = H(\text{parent}) - \sum_{j=1}^m \frac{N_j}{N} H(\text{child}_j)$$

Excellent for:
- Interpretable models
- Mixed data types
- Feature importance analysis
- When non-linear relationships exist

## Algorithm Selection Guide 🧭

### Classification Tasks
```python
def select_classifier(data_characteristics):
    if data_characteristics.text_data:
        return "Naive Bayes"
    elif data_characteristics.need_interpretability:
        return "Decision Tree"
    elif data_characteristics.high_dimensional:
        return "SVM"
    elif data_characteristics.well_clustered:
        return "kNN"
    else:
        return "Try multiple and compare"
```
