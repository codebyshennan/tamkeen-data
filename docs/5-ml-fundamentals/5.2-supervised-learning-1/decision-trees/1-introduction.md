# Introduction to Decision Trees

## Why Learn Decision Trees?

Decision trees are one of the most intuitive and powerful machine learning algorithms. They're perfect for beginners because:

- They mimic how humans make decisions
- They're easy to visualize and understand
- They can handle both numbers and categories
- They provide clear explanations for predictions

## What is a Decision Tree?

Imagine you're trying to decide whether to go for a walk. You might ask yourself:

1. Is it raining? (No)
2. Is it too hot? (No)
3. Do I have time? (Yes)
4. Then I'll go for a walk!

This is exactly how a decision tree works! It's a series of yes/no questions that lead to a final decision.

### Real-World Examples

1. **Medical Diagnosis**
   - Doctor: "Do you have a fever?" (Yes)
   - Doctor: "Is it above 101Â°F?" (No)
   - Doctor: "Do you have a cough?" (Yes)
   - Diagnosis: "You might have a mild infection"

2. **Loan Approval**
   - Bank: "Is your income above $50,000?" (Yes)
   - Bank: "Is your credit score above 700?" (No)
   - Bank: "Do you have any existing loans?" (No)
   - Decision: "Loan approved with higher interest rate"
