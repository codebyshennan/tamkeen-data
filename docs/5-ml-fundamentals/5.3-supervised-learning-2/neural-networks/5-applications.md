## 1. Computer Vision: Teaching Computers to See

Computer vision is like giving computers the ability to understand and interpret visual information, just like humans do.

### Image Classification: Identifying Objects

Image classification is like teaching a computer to recognize different types of objects in photos. For example, identifying whether an image contains a cat or a dog.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

def create_image_classifier(num_classes):
    """Create a model to classify images into different categories"""
    # Load pre-trained ResNet50 model
    base_model = ResNet50(
        weights='imagenet',  # Use weights trained on ImageNet
        include_top=False,   # Don't include the final classification layer
        input_shape=(224, 224, 3)  # Standard image size
    )
    
    # Freeze the pre-trained layers
    base_model.trainable = False
    
    # Add our custom classification layers
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        base_model,
        tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(),  # Convert features to vector
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'),  # Add a dense layer
        tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5),  # Prevent overfitting
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')  # Output layer
    ])
    
    return model

# Prepare data with augmentation
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rescale=1./255,  # Normalize pixel values
    rotation_range=20,  # Randomly rotate images
    width_shift_range=0.2,  # Randomly shift width
    height_shift_range=0.2,  # Randomly shift height
    horizontal_flip=True,  # Randomly flip horizontally
    fill_mode='nearest'  # How to fill empty spaces
)

# Create data generator
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    'train_dir',  # Directory containing training images
    target_size=(224, 224),  # Resize images
    batch_size=32,  # Number of images per batch
    class_mode='categorical'  # Type of classification
)

# Create and train model
model = create_image_classifier(num_classes=10)
model.compile(
    optimizer='adam',
    loss='categorical_crossentropy',
    metrics=['accuracy']
)

history = model.fit(
    train_generator,
    epochs=20,
    callbacks=[
        tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(patience=3)  # Stop if no improvement
    ]
)
```

### Object Detection: Finding and Locating Objects

Object detection is like teaching a computer to not only recognize objects but also find where they are in an image. This is useful for applications like self-driving cars or security systems.

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

def create_object_detector():
    """Create a YOLO object detector"""
    # Load pre-trained YOLO model
    model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')  # Small version for faster training
    
    # Train the model
    model.train(
        data='data.yaml',  # Configuration file
        epochs=100,        # Number of training cycles
        imgsz=640,         # Image size
        batch=16,          # Batch size
        save=True          # Save the model
    )
    
    return model

def detect_objects(model, image):
    """Detect objects in an image"""
    # Run detection
    results = model(image)
    
    # Process results
    boxes = results[0].boxes
    for box in boxes:
        # Get coordinates of detected object
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = box.xyxy[0]
        confidence = box.conf[0]
        class_id = box.cls[0]
        
        print(f"Found: {class_id} with {confidence:.2f} confidence")
```

## 2. Natural Language Processing: Understanding Text

NLP is like teaching computers to understand and work with human language, from simple tasks like sentiment analysis to complex ones like translation.

### Text Classification: Understanding Sentiment

Text classification helps computers understand the meaning or sentiment of text, like determining if a product review is positive or negative.

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, TFBertForSequenceClassification
import tensorflow as tf

def create_text_classifier(num_labels):
    """Create a BERT model for text classification"""
    # Load pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer
    tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
    model = TFBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
        'bert-base-uncased',
        num_labels=num_labels
    )
    
    return model, tokenizer

def prepare_text_data(texts, tokenizer, max_length=128):
    """Prepare text for BERT model"""
    return tokenizer(
        texts,
        padding=True,      # Add padding to make all sequences same length
        truncation=True,   # Cut off text if too long
        max_length=max_length,
        return_tensors='tf'  # Return TensorFlow tensors
    )

# Example: Sentiment Analysis
texts = [
    "This product is amazing! I love it!",
    "Terrible customer service, would not recommend.",
    "It's okay, nothing special."
]
labels = [1, 0, 2]  # Positive, Negative, Neutral

# Create and train model
model, tokenizer = create_text_classifier(num_labels=3)
inputs = prepare_text_data(texts, tokenizer)

model.compile(
    optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=2e-5),
    loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
    metrics=['accuracy']
)

model.fit(
    inputs,
    labels,
    epochs=3,
    batch_size=32
)
```

### Machine Translation: Breaking Language Barriers

Machine translation helps computers translate text from one language to another, like having a digital translator in your pocket.

```python
from transformers import MarianMTModel, MarianTokenizer

def create_translator(src_lang='en', tgt_lang='fr'):
    """Create a machine translation model"""
    # Load pre-trained translation model
    model_name = f'Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-{src_lang}-{tgt_lang}'
    
    tokenizer = MarianTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    model = MarianMTModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
    
    return model, tokenizer

def translate_text(text, model, tokenizer):
    """Translate text from source to target language"""
    # Prepare text for model
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt', padding=True)
    
    # Generate translation
    outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
    
    # Convert back to text
    translation = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    
    return translation

# Example usage
model, tokenizer = create_translator('en', 'fr')
text = "Hello, how are you today?"
translation = translate_text(text, model, tokenizer)
print(f"English: {text}")
print(f"French: {translation}")
```

## 3. Time Series Analysis: Predicting the Future

Time series analysis helps computers understand and predict patterns in data that changes over time, like stock prices or weather patterns.

### Stock Price Prediction

Predicting stock prices is like trying to forecast the weather - we use past patterns to predict future movements.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
import yfinance as yf

def create_stock_predictor(sequence_length):
    """Create an LSTM model for stock prediction"""
    model = Sequential([
        LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(sequence_length, 1)),
        Dense(1)  # Predict next day's price
    ])
    
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    return model

def prepare_sequences(data, sequence_length):
    """Prepare time series data for LSTM"""
    X, y = [], []
    for i in range(len(data) - sequence_length):
        X.append(data[i:i+sequence_length])
        y.append(data[i+sequence_length])
    return np.array(X), np.array(y)

# Get stock data
stock = yf.Ticker('AAPL')
data = stock.history(period='1y')['Close'].values

# Normalize data
data = (data - data.mean()) / data.std()

# Prepare sequences
sequence_length = 10  # Use 10 days to predict next day
X, y = prepare_sequences(data, sequence_length)

# Create and train model
model = create_stock_predictor(sequence_length)
model.fit(X, y, epochs=50, batch_size=32)
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using Too Complex Models**
