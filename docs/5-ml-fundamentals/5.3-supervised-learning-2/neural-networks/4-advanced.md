## Advanced Architectures

### 1. Residual Networks (ResNet)

ResNet is like building a highway through your neural network - it allows information to flow more easily through deep networks by adding "shortcut" connections.

#### Real-World Analogy

Imagine you're learning to play a complex piece of music. Instead of starting from scratch each time, you can jump to different sections using bookmarks. ResNet works similarly, allowing the network to "jump" over layers when needed.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def residual_block(x, filters, kernel_size=3):
    """Create a residual block with shortcut connection"""
    # Save the input for the shortcut
    shortcut = x
    
    # First convolution
    x = layers.Conv2D(filters, kernel_size, padding='same')(x)
    x = layers.BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = layers.ReLU()(x)
    
    # Second convolution
    x = layers.Conv2D(filters, kernel_size, padding='same')(x)
    x = layers.BatchNormalization()(x)
    
    # Add shortcut if dimensions don't match
    if shortcut.shape[-1] != filters:
        shortcut = layers.Conv2D(filters, 1)(shortcut)
    
    # Add shortcut to output
    x = layers.Add()([x, shortcut])
    x = layers.ReLU()(x)
    
    return x

# Create a simple ResNet for image classification
def create_resnet(input_shape, num_classes):
    """Create a ResNet model for image classification"""
    inputs = layers.Input(shape=input_shape)
    
    # Initial processing
    x = layers.Conv2D(64, 7, strides=2, padding='same')(inputs)
    x = layers.BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = layers.ReLU()(x)
    x = layers.MaxPooling2D(3, strides=2, padding='same')(x)
    
    # Stack of residual blocks
    x = residual_block(x, 64)
    x = residual_block(x, 128, strides=2)
    x = residual_block(x, 256, strides=2)
    x = residual_block(x, 512, strides=2)
    
    # Final processing
    x = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
    outputs = layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(x)
    
    return tf.keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
```

### 2. Attention Mechanism

Attention is like having a spotlight that helps the network focus on the most important parts of the input.

#### Real-World Analogy

When reading a book, you don't pay equal attention to every word. Some words are more important for understanding the story. Attention mechanisms work similarly, helping the network focus on relevant information.

```python
class AttentionLayer(layers.Layer):
    """Custom attention layer for focusing on important features"""
    def __init__(self, units):
        super().__init__()
        self.W = layers.Dense(units)  # For processing the input
        self.V = layers.Dense(1)      # For computing attention scores
    
    def call(self, query, values):
        # Process the values
        processed_values = self.W(values)
        
        # Compute attention scores
        attention_scores = self.V(tf.nn.tanh(processed_values))
        
        # Convert scores to weights
        attention_weights = tf.nn.softmax(attention_scores, axis=1)
        
        # Apply weights to values
        context_vector = attention_weights * values
        context_vector = tf.reduce_sum(context_vector, axis=1)
        
        return context_vector, attention_weights
```

### 3. Transformer Architecture

Transformers are like having a team of experts who can communicate with each other to understand complex relationships in data.

#### Real-World Analogy

Imagine a group of experts in a meeting. Each expert can directly communicate with any other expert, and they all work together to solve a problem. Transformers work similarly, allowing different parts of the network to communicate directly.

```python
def scaled_dot_product_attention(q, k, v, mask=None):
    """Calculate attention weights using scaled dot product"""
    # Compute similarity between query and key
    matmul_qk = tf.matmul(q, k, transpose_b=True)
    
    # Scale by square root of dimension
    dk = tf.cast(tf.shape(k)[-1], tf.float32)
    scaled_attention_logits = matmul_qk / tf.math.sqrt(dk)
    
    # Apply mask if provided
    if mask is not None:
        scaled_attention_logits += (mask * -1e9)
    
    # Convert to probabilities
    attention_weights = tf.nn.softmax(
        scaled_attention_logits, axis=-1
    )
    
    # Apply weights to values
    output = tf.matmul(attention_weights, v)
    return output, attention_weights
```

## Advanced Training Techniques

### 1. Curriculum Learning

Curriculum learning is like teaching a child - start with simple concepts and gradually increase difficulty.

#### Real-World Example

When learning to play chess:

1. Start with basic piece movements
2. Learn simple strategies
3. Practice against easy opponents
4. Gradually face more challenging opponents

```python
class CurriculumDataGenerator:
    """Generate data with increasing difficulty"""
    def __init__(self, data, labels, difficulty_fn):
        self.data = data
        self.labels = labels
        self.difficulty_fn = difficulty_fn
        self.epoch = 0
    
    def get_batch(self, batch_size):
        # Calculate current difficulty threshold
        threshold = min(1.0, 0.2 + 0.1 * self.epoch)
        
        # Get sample difficulties
        difficulties = self.difficulty_fn(self.data)
        
        # Select samples below threshold
        mask = difficulties <= threshold
        eligible_data = self.data[mask]
        eligible_labels = self.labels[mask]
        
        # Sample batch
        indices = np.random.choice(
            len(eligible_data),
            size=batch_size
        )
        
        return eligible_data[indices], eligible_labels[indices]
```

### 2. Mixed Precision Training

Mixed precision training is like using different tools for different tasks - some operations are done with less precision to save memory and speed up training.

#### Real-World Analogy

When cooking, you might use precise measurements for baking (exact grams) but approximate measurements for cooking (handful of herbs). Mixed precision works similarly, using high precision where needed and lower precision where acceptable.

```python
# Enable mixed precision
policy = tf.keras.mixed_precision.Policy('mixed_float16')
tf.keras.mixed_precision.set_global_policy(policy)

# Create model with mixed precision
def create_mixed_precision_model():
    model = create_model()  # Your model architecture
    
    # Ensure last layer uses float32 for stability
    model.outputs[0].dtype = 'float32'
    
    # Use mixed precision optimizer
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1e-3)
    optimizer = tf.keras.mixed_precision.LossScaleOptimizer(
        optimizer
    )
    
    return model, optimizer
```
