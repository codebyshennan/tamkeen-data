# Real-World Applications of Gradient Boosting

Welcome to the practical world of Gradient Boosting! In this guide, we'll explore how this powerful technique is used to solve real problems in various industries. Think of this as seeing how professional chefs use their skills in different types of restaurants.

## 1. Financial Applications: Making Smart Money Decisions

### Credit Risk Assessment: Who Gets a Loan?

Imagine you're a bank manager deciding who to give loans to. Gradient Boosting can help make these decisions smarter and fairer.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Create sample credit data
# Think of this as collecting information about loan applicants
np.random.seed(42)
n_samples = 1000

data = pd.DataFrame({
    'income': np.random.normal(50000, 20000, n_samples),        # Annual income
    'age': np.random.normal(40, 10, n_samples),                 # Applicant age
    'employment_length': np.random.normal(8, 4, n_samples),     # Years employed
    'debt_ratio': np.random.uniform(0.1, 0.6, n_samples),       # Debt to income ratio
    'credit_score': np.random.normal(700, 50, n_samples),       # Credit score
    'previous_defaults': np.random.randint(0, 3, n_samples),    # Past defaults
    'loan_amount': np.random.normal(200000, 100000, n_samples)  # Requested loan
})

# Create target (default probability)
# This is like marking which applicants actually defaulted
data['default'] = (
    (data['debt_ratio'] > 0.4) & 
    (data['credit_score'] < 650) |
    (data['previous_defaults'] > 1)
).astype(int)

# Train credit risk model

    y = data['default']               # Target (will they default?)
    
    # Split into training and testing sets
    # Like dividing applicants into practice and test groups
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        X, y, 
        test_size=0.2,  # 20% for testing
        random_state=42
    )

    # Calculate credit score (inverse of default probability)
    credit_score = 100 * (1 - default_prob)
    
    # Get feature importance for this prediction
    # Like understanding which factors most affect the decision

        'importance': model.feature_importances_
    }).sort_values('importance', ascending=False)
    
    # Generate recommendations

    recommendations = []
    if default_prob > 0.3:
        if applicant_data['debt_ratio'].values[0] > 0.4:
            recommendations.append("Reduce debt ratio")
        if applicant_data['credit_score'].values[0] < 650:

### Stock Market Prediction: Finding Patterns in Market Data

Let's build a system that can help predict stock movements. Think of this as having a smart assistant for stock trading.

```python
import yfinance as yf
from lightgbm import LGBMRegressor

def create_stock_features(data, lookback=30):
    """Create technical indicators from stock data
    
    Think of this as creating a set of measurements
    that help predict future prices
    """
    df = data.copy()
    
    # Price-based indicators
    df['SMA_20'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()  # 20-day average
    df['SMA_50'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()  # 50-day average
    df['RSI'] = calculate_rsi(df['Close'])                # Relative strength
    
    # Volume indicators
    df['Volume_SMA'] = df['Volume'].rolling(window=20).mean()
    df['Volume_Ratio'] = df['Volume'] / df['Volume_SMA']
    
    # Volatility indicators
    df['Daily_Return'] = df['Close'].pct_change()
    df['Volatility'] = df['Daily_Return'].rolling(window=20).std()
    
    # Target: Next day return
    df['Target'] = df['Close'].shift(-1) / df['Close'] - 1
    
    return df.dropna()

def train_stock_predictor(symbol='AAPL', lookback_days=30):
    """Train a model to predict stock movements

    # Train model
    model = LGBMRegressor(
        n_estimators=100,    # Number of trees
        learning_rate=0.05,  # Learning rate
        max_depth=5          # Tree depth
    )
    
    # Implement walk-forward optimization
    # Like testing the model on new data as it becomes available
    predictions = []
    train_size = 252  # One year of trading days
    
    for i in range(train_size, len(df)):
        # Get training data
        train_data = df.iloc[i-train_size:i]
        X_train = train_data.drop(['Target'], axis=1)
        y_train = train_data['Target']
        
        # Train model
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)

        X_test = df.iloc[i:i+1].drop(['Target'], axis=1)
        pred = model.predict(X_test)
        predictions.append(pred[0])
    
    return model, predictions
```

## 2. Healthcare Applications: Predicting Health Risks

### Disease Risk Prediction: Early Warning System

Imagine you're a doctor trying to predict which patients might develop certain conditions. Gradient Boosting can help identify at-risk patients early.

```python
def train_disease_predictor(medical_data):
    """Train a model to predict disease risk
    
    Think of this as creating a digital health assistant
    that can spot potential health issues
    """
    # Prepare features
    features = [
        'age', 'bmi', 'blood_pressure', 'cholesterol',
        'glucose', 'smoking', 'family_history'
    ]
    
    X = medical_data[features]  # Patient characteristics
    y = medical_data['disease'] # Disease status
    
    # Train model with cross-validation
    model = XGBClassifier(
        max_depth=3,           # Keep model simple
        learning_rate=0.1,     # Moderate learning rate
        n_estimators=100       # Number of trees
    )
    
    # Use stratified k-fold
    # Like testing the model on different groups of patients
    cv_scores = cross_val_score(
        model, X, y,
        cv=StratifiedKFold(5),
        scoring='roc_auc'
    )
    
    # Train final model
    model.fit(X, y)
    
    return model

def assess_patient_risk(model, patient_data):
    """Assess a patient's disease risk
    
    This is like a doctor reviewing a patient's
    health profile and making recommendations

    # Get probability
    risk_prob = model.predict_proba(patient_data)[0, 1]
    
    # Risk category
    if risk_prob < 0.2:
        risk_level = "Low"
    elif risk_prob < 0.6:
        risk_level = "Moderate"
    else:
        risk_level = "High"
    
    # Get feature importance
    # Like understanding which factors most affect risk
    importance = pd.DataFrame({
        'factor': patient_data.columns,
        'importance': model.feature_importances_
    }).sort_values('importance', ascending=False)
    
    # Generate recommendations
    # Like giving personalized health advice
    recommendations = []
    if risk_prob > 0.3:
        if patient_data['smoking'].values[0] == 1:
            recommendations.append("Stop smoking")
        if patient_data['bmi'].values[0] > 30:
            recommendations.append("Reduce BMI")
        if patient_data['blood_pressure'].values[0] > 140:
            recommendations.append("Control blood pressure")
    
    return {
        'risk_probability': risk_prob,
        'risk_level': risk_level,
        'key_factors': importance.head(3),
        'recommendations': recommendations
    }
```

## 3. Marketing Applications: Understanding Customers

### Customer Churn Prediction: Keeping Customers Happy

Let's build a system that can predict which customers might leave a service. This is like having a crystal ball for customer retention.

```python
from catboost import CatBoostClassifier

def predict_customer_churn(customer_data):
    """Predict which customers might leave
    
    Think of this as having a customer service
    assistant that can spot unhappy customers
    """
    # Prepare features
    features = [
        'tenure', 'monthly_charges', 'total_charges',
        'contract_type', 'payment_method', 'internet_service',
        'online_security', 'tech_support', 'streaming_tv'
    ]
    
    # Specify categorical features
    cat_features = [
        'contract_type', 'payment_method', 'internet_service',
        'online_security', 'tech_support', 'streaming_tv'
    ]
    
    # Train model
    model = CatBoostClassifier(
        iterations=200,           # Number of trees
        learning_rate=0.1,        # Learning rate
        depth=6,                  # Tree depth
        loss_function='Logloss',  # Loss function
        verbose=False             # Don't show training progress
    )
    
    # Train the model
    model.fit(
        customer_data[features],
        customer_data['churn'],
        cat_features=cat_features
    )
    
    return model
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Ignoring Data Quality**
   - Like cooking with spoiled ingredients
   - Can lead to poor predictions
   - Solution: Clean and validate data first

2. **Overfitting to Specific Cases**
   - Like memorizing recipes instead of learning to cook
   - Won't work well on new data
   - Solution: Use cross-validation

3. **Not Considering Business Context**
   - Like cooking without knowing who you're cooking for
   - Can lead to impractical solutions
   - Solution: Understand the real-world problem

## Next Steps

Ready to try these applications? Start with the credit risk example and gradually move to more complex projects. Remember, the key is to understand both the technical aspects and the real-world context!
