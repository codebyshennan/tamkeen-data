# Early Stopping

## Introduction

Early stopping is a regularization technique that helps prevent overfitting by monitoring the model's performance on a validation set and stopping training when performance starts to degrade.

## What is Early Stopping?

Early stopping works by monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training. When the performance stops improving or starts to degrade, training is stopped to prevent overfitting.

### Why Early Stopping Matters

1. Prevents overfitting
2. Saves computational resources
3. Automates model training
4. Improves model generalization

## Real-World Analogies

### The Student Study Analogy

Think of early stopping like studying for an exam:

- Training: Studying the material
- Validation: Taking practice tests
- Early stopping: Stopping when practice test scores start to decline

### The Sports Training Analogy

Early stopping is like sports training:

- Training: Practicing skills
- Validation: Performance in practice games
- Early stopping: Stopping when performance plateaus

## Implementation

### 1. Basic Early Stopping

```python
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Split data into train, validation, and test sets
X_train, X_temp, y_train, y_temp = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
X_val, X_test, y_val, y_test = train_test_split(X_temp, y_temp, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)

# Initialize model
model = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(100, 50), max_iter=1000)

# Train with early stopping
best_val_score = 0
patience = 5
no_improvement = 0

for epoch in range(1000):
    model.partial_fit(X_train, y_train, classes=np.unique(y))
    val_score = model.score(X_val, y_val)
    
    if val_score > best_val_score:
        best_val_score = val_score
        no_improvement = 0
    else:
        no_improvement += 1
    
    if no_improvement >= patience:
        print(f"Early stopping at epoch {epoch}")
        break
```

### 2. Using Scikit-learn's Early Stopping

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

# Create pipeline with early stopping
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('classifier', SGDClassifier(early_stopping=True, validation_fraction=0.2))
])

# Fit and evaluate
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Early Stopping Score: {pipeline.score(X_test, y_test):.3f}")
```

### 3. Custom Early Stopping Class

```python
class EarlyStopping:
    def __init__(self, patience=5, min_delta=0):
        self.patience = patience
        self.min_delta = min_delta
        self.best_score = None
        self.counter = 0
        self.should_stop = False
    
    def __call__(self, val_score):
        if self.best_score is None:
            self.best_score = val_score
        elif val_score < self.best_score + self.min_delta:
            self.counter += 1
            if self.counter >= self.patience:
                self.should_stop = True
        else:
            self.best_score = val_score
            self.counter = 0
        
        return self.should_stop

# Use custom early stopping
early_stopping = EarlyStopping(patience=5)
for epoch in range(1000):
    model.partial_fit(X_train, y_train, classes=np.unique(y))
    val_score = model.score(X_val, y_val)
    
    if early_stopping(val_score):
        print(f"Early stopping at epoch {epoch}")
        break
```

## Best Practices

1. **Choose Appropriate Metrics**
   - Use validation metrics
   - Consider business objectives
   - Monitor multiple metrics

2. **Set Proper Parameters**
   - Choose appropriate patience
   - Set minimum improvement threshold
   - Consider computational resources

3. **Monitor Training**
   - Track training progress
   - Visualize learning curves
   - Save best model

4. **Validate Results**
   - Test on holdout set
   - Compare with baseline
   - Check for overfitting

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too Short Patience**
   - Premature stopping
   - Underfitting
   - Missed improvements

2. **Too Long Patience**
   - Wasted computation
   - Overfitting
   - Poor generalization

3. **Wrong Metrics**
   - Misleading early stopping
   - Poor model selection
   - Inappropriate validation

## Practical Example: Credit Risk Prediction

Let's see how early stopping helps in a credit risk prediction task:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

# Create credit risk dataset
np.random.seed(42)
n_samples = 1000

# Generate features
age = np.random.normal(35, 10, n_samples)
income = np.random.exponential(50000, n_samples)
credit_score = np.random.normal(700, 100, n_samples)

X = np.column_stack([age, income, credit_score])
y = (credit_score + income/1000 + age > 800).astype(int)  # Binary target

# Create pipeline with early stopping
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('classifier', RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=10))
])

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Train with early stopping
best_score = 0
best_model = None
patience = 5
no_improvement = 0

for n_estimators in range(10, 100, 10):
    pipeline.set_params(classifier__n_estimators=n_estimators)
    pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
    score = pipeline.score(X_test, y_test)
    
    if score > best_score:
        best_score = score
        best_model = pipeline
        no_improvement = 0
    else:
        no_improvement += 1
    
    if no_improvement >= patience:
        print(f"Early stopping at {n_estimators} trees")
        break

print(f"Best model score: {best_score:.3f}")
```
