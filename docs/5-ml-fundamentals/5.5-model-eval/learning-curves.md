# Learning Curves

## Introduction

Learning curves are powerful tools for diagnosing model performance and understanding how our model learns from data. They help us identify issues like overfitting and underfitting, and guide us in making better decisions about model complexity and data requirements.

## What are Learning Curves?

Learning curves plot the model's performance (e.g., accuracy or error) against the amount of training data. They show us how the model's performance changes as we add more training examples.

### Why Learning Curves Matter

1. Diagnose model performance issues
2. Determine if more data would help
3. Identify overfitting or underfitting
4. Guide model selection and tuning

## Real-World Analogies

### The Student Learning Analogy

Think of learning curves like a student's progress:

- Training curve: How well the student performs on practice problems
- Validation curve: How well the student performs on new problems
- Gap between curves: How well the student generalizes

### The Sports Training Analogy

Learning curves are like sports training:

- Training curve: Performance in practice
- Validation curve: Performance in games
- Gap between curves: Ability to apply skills in real situations

## Understanding Learning Curves

### 1. Ideal Learning Curve

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import learning_curve
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Create sample dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, 
                         n_informative=15, n_redundant=5,
                         random_state=42)

# Calculate learning curves
train_sizes, train_scores, val_scores = learning_curve(
    LogisticRegression(),
    X, y,
    cv=5,
    n_jobs=-1,
    train_sizes=np.linspace(0.1, 1.0, 10)
)

# Calculate mean and standard deviation
train_mean = np.mean(train_scores, axis=1)
train_std = np.std(train_scores, axis=1)
val_mean = np.mean(val_scores, axis=1)
val_std = np.std(val_scores, axis=1)

# Plot learning curves
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(train_sizes, train_mean, label='Training score')
plt.plot(train_sizes, val_mean, label='Cross-validation score')
plt.fill_between(train_sizes, train_mean - train_std, train_mean + train_std, alpha=0.1)
plt.fill_between(train_sizes, val_mean - val_std, val_mean + val_std, alpha=0.1)
plt.xlabel('Training Examples')
plt.ylabel('Score')
plt.title('Learning Curves')
plt.legend(loc='best')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### 2. Overfitting Learning Curve

```python
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier

# Calculate learning curves for a complex model
train_sizes, train_scores, val_scores = learning_curve(
    MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(100, 50)),
    X, y,
    cv=5,
    n_jobs=-1,
    train_sizes=np.linspace(0.1, 1.0, 10)
)

# Plot overfitting learning curves
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(train_sizes, train_mean, label='Training score')
plt.plot(train_sizes, val_mean, label='Cross-validation score')
plt.fill_between(train_sizes, train_mean - train_std, train_mean + train_std, alpha=0.1)
plt.fill_between(train_sizes, val_mean - val_std, val_mean + val_std, alpha=0.1)
plt.xlabel('Training Examples')
plt.ylabel('Score')
plt.title('Overfitting Learning Curves')
plt.legend(loc='best')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### 3. Underfitting Learning Curve

```python
from sklearn.dummy import DummyClassifier

# Calculate learning curves for a simple model
train_sizes, train_scores, val_scores = learning_curve(
    DummyClassifier(),
    X, y,
    cv=5,
    n_jobs=-1,
    train_sizes=np.linspace(0.1, 1.0, 10)
)

# Plot underfitting learning curves
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(train_sizes, train_mean, label='Training score')
plt.plot(train_sizes, val_mean, label='Cross-validation score')
plt.fill_between(train_sizes, train_mean - train_std, train_mean + train_std, alpha=0.1)
plt.fill_between(train_sizes, val_mean - val_std, val_mean + val_std, alpha=0.1)
plt.xlabel('Training Examples')
plt.ylabel('Score')
plt.title('Underfitting Learning Curves')
plt.legend(loc='best')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

## Interpreting Learning Curves

### 1. High Bias (Underfitting)

- Both curves plateau at low performance
- Small gap between curves
- More data won't help much

### 2. High Variance (Overfitting)

- Training curve much higher than validation curve
- Large gap between curves
- More data might help

### 3. Good Fit

- Both curves plateau at high performance
- Small gap between curves
- Model generalizes well

## Best Practices

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Use sufficient training data
   - Clean and preprocess data
   - Handle outliers appropriately

2. **Model Selection**
   - Start with simple models
   - Gradually increase complexity
   - Use cross-validation

3. **Regularization**
   - Apply appropriate regularization
   - Tune regularization parameters
   - Monitor validation performance

4. **Monitoring**
   - Track training and validation metrics
   - Use learning curves
   - Implement early stopping

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Overfitting**
   - Using too complex models
   - Not using validation sets
   - Ignoring regularization

2. **Underfitting**
   - Using too simple models
   - Not considering feature engineering
   - Insufficient training time
