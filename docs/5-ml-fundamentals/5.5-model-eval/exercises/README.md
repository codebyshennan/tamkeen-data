# Model Evaluation Exercises - Progressive Learning Path

Welcome to the Model Evaluation exercises! This directory contains a carefully structured progression of exercises designed to build your skills from basic concepts to advanced real-world applications.

## üéØ Learning Philosophy

These exercises follow a **progressive difficulty structure**:
- **Beginner**: Focus on single concepts with guided practice
- **Intermediate**: Combine multiple concepts with moderate complexity
