## Assignment üìù

Ready to apply your model evaluation knowledge? Head over to the [Model Evaluation Assignment](../_assignments/5.5-assignment.md) to test your understanding of cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and pipeline development!

## Getting Started

Begin with [Cross Validation](./cross-validation.md) to understand how to properly evaluate your models. Each subsequent topic builds upon previous concepts, so it's recommended to follow the order presented.

## Best Practices Overview

1. **Cross Validation**
   - Always use stratification for classification
   - Consider temporal aspects for time series
   - Use appropriate folds for your data size
   - Validate assumptions about data independence

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Start with broad parameter ranges
   - Use random search for initial exploration
   - Apply Bayesian optimization for refinement
   - Monitor computational resources

3. **Pipeline Development**
   - Keep transformations inside pipeline
   - Use custom transformers for clarity
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Document pipeline components

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Data Leakage**
   - Scaling outside cross-validation
   - Feature selection before splitting
   - Target encoding without proper validation

2. **Evaluation Mistakes**
   - Using wrong metrics
   - Ignoring class imbalance
   - Not considering business context
   - Overfitting to validation set

3. **Pipeline Issues**
   - Memory management problems
   - Insufficient error handling
   - Poor documentation
   - Inflexible design
