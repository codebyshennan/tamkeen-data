### Real-World Applications
NumPy is everywhere:
- 📊 Data Analysis
- 🤖 Machine Learning
- 📸 Image Processing
- 📈 Financial Analysis
{% endstep %}

## Understanding Data Types 📝

Let's break down data types in a way that's easy to understand!

### 1. Nominal Data (Names/Categories) 🏷️

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### What is it?
Like putting labels on things:
- 🎨 Colors (Red, Blue, Green)
- 🍽️ Cuisines (Italian, Chinese, Mexican)
- 👕 T-shirt sizes (S, M, L, XL)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Key Features
- No order (Blue isn't "more than" Red)
- Just categories
- Each item fits one category
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### What You Can Do
✅ Count how many in each category
✅ Find most common (mode)
❌ Can't calculate average
❌ Can't find median
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### 2. Ordinal Data (Ordered Categories) 📊

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### What is it?
Categories with a clear order:
- 🌶️ Spice levels (Mild → Medium → Hot)
- ⭐ Ratings (1 star → 5 stars)
- 📚 Education (High School → Bachelor's → Master's)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Key Features
- Has order (Hot is more than Mild)
- Spacing might not be equal
- Still categories, but ranked
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### What You Can Do
✅ Everything from Nominal
✅ Compare (greater/less than)
✅ Find median
❌ Can't calculate average
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### 3. Interval Data (Equal Steps) 📏

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### What is it?
Numbers with equal steps between values:
- 🌡️ Temperature (Celsius/Fahrenheit)
- 📅 Calendar years
- 🧠 IQ scores
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Key Features
- Equal spacing between values
- No true zero point
- Can add and subtract
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### What You Can Do
✅ Everything from Ordinal
✅ Calculate average
✅ Find differences
❌ Can't say "twice as much"
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### 4. Ratio Data (True Zero) 📐

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### What is it?
Numbers with a meaningful zero:
- 📏 Height
- ⚖️ Weight
- 💰 Money
- ⏱️ Time
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Key Features
- Has true zero (0 height means no height)
- Can compare ratios
- Most flexible type
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### What You Can Do
✅ Everything from Interval
✅ Multiply and divide
✅ Say "twice as much"
✅ All math operations
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Quick Reference Guide 📝

### Data Type Summary
```
Level     Order?   Equal Steps?   True Zero?   Example
Nominal    ❌        ❌            ❌         Colors
Ordinal    ✅        ❌            ❌         Ratings
Interval   ✅        ✅            ❌         Temperature
Ratio      ✅        ✅            ✅         Height
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Categorical vs. Continuous
1. **Categorical** (Discrete) 📦
   - Distinct groups
   - Like boxes to sort things
   - Example: T-shirt sizes

2. **Continuous** (Measurement) 📊
   - Any value in a range
   - Like a ruler
   - Example: Height in cm
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
