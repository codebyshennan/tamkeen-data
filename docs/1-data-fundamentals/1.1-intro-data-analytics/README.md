## What is Data Science?

Data science is like being both a detective and an inventor. While data analytics focuses on understanding what's happening now and what happened in the past, data science creates new ways to solve future problems using advanced techniques like machine learning, statistical modeling, and algorithmic approaches.

### The Data Science Process

{% step %}
### 1. Data Collection
**Example**: A streaming service like Netflix collecting:
- User viewing history (watch time, completion rates)
- Search queries and results clicked
- Pause/rewind/fast-forward patterns
- Device information and quality settings
- Time spent browsing vs watching
- Rating and review data
- Account sharing patterns
- Network performance metrics

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
# Example data collection schema
viewing_data = {
    'user_id': 'string',
    'content_id': 'string',
    'timestamp': 'datetime',
    'watch_duration': 'integer',
    'device_type': 'string',
    'quality_setting': 'string',
    'network_speed': 'float'
}
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 2. Data Cleaning
**Example**: Preparing streaming data by:
- Removing incomplete viewing sessions (<10 seconds)
- Fixing timestamp errors across time zones
- Standardizing show categories and genres
- Handling missing ratings and reviews
- Normalizing device names and types
- Filtering out bot/test accounts
- Correcting metadata inconsistencies
- Dealing with VPN-related location issues

**Code Example**:
```python
def clean_viewing_data(df):
    # Remove short sessions
    df = df[df['watch_duration'] >= 10]
    
    # Standardize timestamps to UTC
    df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp']).dt.tz_convert('UTC')
    
    # Normalize device types
    df['device_type'] = df['device_type'].str.lower().replace({
        'iphone': 'mobile',
        'android_phone': 'mobile',
        'smart_tv': 'tv',
        'roku': 'tv'
    })
    
    return df
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 3. Data Exploration
**Example**: Discovering patterns like:
- Popular genres by time of day and region
- Viewing duration patterns by content type
- Content that keeps viewers engaged longest
- Seasonal viewing trends and preferences
- Correlation between rating and completion
- Impact of auto-play on session length
- Device preferences by demographic
- Binge-watching behavior analysis

**Analysis Example**:
```python
# Analyze viewing patterns
import seaborn as sns

# Genre popularity by hour
sns.heatmap(genre_hour_matrix, 
           cmap='YlOrRd',
           xticklabels=hours,
           yticklabels=genres)

# Completion rate analysis
completion_rate = watched_duration / content_duration
engagement_score = completion_rate * rating
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 4. Modeling
**Example**: Creating algorithms to:
- Predict what shows a user might like (recommendation system)
- Determine optimal video quality settings based on network
- Forecast server capacity needs by region
- Identify potential churning customers
- Optimize content delivery networks
- Personalize thumbnail images
- Predict show success probability
- Optimize auto-play timing

**Model Example**:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Train recommendation model
def train_recommendation_model(user_data, content_data):
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
    features = ['genre_score', 'duration_preference', 
                'similar_content_rating', 'time_of_day_score']
    
    model.fit(X_train[features], y_train['watched'])
    return model
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 5. Deployment
**Example**: Implementing solutions like:
- Personalized recommendation system
- Automated content categorization
- Dynamic quality adjustment
- Proactive retention campaigns
- A/B testing framework
- Real-time analytics pipeline
- Automated reporting system
- Performance monitoring dashboard

**Deployment Example**:
```python
# API endpoint for recommendations
@app.route('/api/recommendations/<user_id>')
def get_recommendations(user_id):
    user_profile = load_user_profile(user_id)
    recommendations = model.predict_top_n(user_profile, n=10)
    return jsonify(recommendations)
```
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
