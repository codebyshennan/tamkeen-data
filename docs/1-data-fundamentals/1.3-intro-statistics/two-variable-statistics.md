# Two-Variable Statistics

## Understanding Relationships Between Variables

Have you ever wondered:

- Does more study time lead to better grades?
- Do taller people weigh more?
- Does ice cream sales affect sunburn cases?

Let's learn how to understand relationships between different variables!

## Correlation vs. Causation

{% stepper %}
{% step %}

### What is Correlation?

When two things tend to move together:

- 📈 **Positive**: Both increase together
  Example: Height and Weight

  ```
  Height: ↑  Weight: ↑
  Height: ↓  Weight: ↓
  ```

- **Negative**: One up, one down
  Example: Price and Sales

  ```
  Price: ↑   Sales: ↓
  Price: ↓   Sales: ↑
  ```

{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### What is Causation?

When one thing CAUSES the other:

- Rain causes wet ground
- Studying causes better grades
- Exercise causes fitness improvement
{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### The Big Mistake

Just because things happen together doesn't mean one causes the other!

Funny Example:

```
Ice cream sales ↑  Sunburns ↑
```

Real cause? Summer weather!
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Remember

```
Correlation ≠ Causation
But
Causation → Correlation
```

## Proving Causation: Experiments

{% stepper %}
{% step %}

### Setting Up an Experiment

Like a detective solving a mystery!

1. **Question**: Does this vitamin help plants grow?
2. **Groups**:
   - Treatment: Gets vitamin
   - Control: No vitamin
3. **Measure**: Plant height after 2 weeks
{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Key Components

- **Independent Variable**: What we change (vitamin)
- **Dependent Variable**: What we measure (height)
- **Control Group**: No changes (no vitamin)
- **Treatment Group**: Gets the change (vitamin)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Making it Scientific

- **Blind Test**: Plants don't know if they got vitamin
- **Double-Blind**: Even researcher doesn't know which is which
- **Random Assignment**: Fair selection for groups
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Watch Out For

{% stepper %}
{% step %}

### Confounding Variables

Other things that might affect results:

```
Studying  Better Grades
But what about:
- Sleep quality 
- Stress levels 
- Teaching quality 
```

{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### The Placebo Effect

People might improve just because they THINK they got treatment!

```
Sugar pill  Feel better
Why? The mind is powerful! 
```

{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Different Ways to Study Relationships

### Types of Studies

{% stepper %}
{% step %}

### 1. Observational Studies

Just watch and record:

```
Example: Do coffee drinkers live longer?
- Watch people's habits
- Record their health
- Don't change anything
```

{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### 2. Retrospective Studies

Look at past data:

```
Example: What caused the success?
- Look at old records
- Find patterns
- Learn from history
```

{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### 3. Prospective Studies

Follow into the future:

```
Example: Will this habit help?
- Start tracking now
- Follow over time
- See what happens
```

{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Visualizing Relationships

### Scatter Plots: A Picture of Relationship

{% stepper %}
{% step %}

### What They Show

Each dot = One pair of measurements

```
   y
   ↑     •
   |   •   •
   | •       •
   |•         •
   +------------→ x
```

{% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Types of Patterns

1. **Positive**: Dots go up

   ```
      •
    •

  •

   ```

2. **Negative**: Dots go down 
   ```

   •
     •
       •

   ```

3. **No Relationship**: Dots scattered
   ```

     •  •
   •    •
     •    •

   ```
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Measuring Correlation 

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Correlation Coefficient (r)
- Goes from -1 to +1
- Perfect patterns = ±1
- No pattern = 0

```

-1 ←|-------|----------|→ +1
  Perfect   No       Perfect
  Negative  Pattern  Positive

```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Examples
```

r = 0.9  → Very strong positive
r = -0.8 → Strong negative
r = 0.2  → Weak positive
r = 0    → No correlation

```
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

💡 **Pro Tips**:
- Always plot your data first!
- Look for unusual patterns
- Remember: correlation ≠ causation
- Use scatter plots to tell the story
