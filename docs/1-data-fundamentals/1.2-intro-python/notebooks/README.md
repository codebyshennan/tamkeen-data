- **Break things** - Errors teach you the most!
- **Fix them** - Practice debugging

### 2. Practice Strategy
```
1. Read the explanation
2. Run the example
3. Modify and re-run
4. Do the challenge
5. Check solution (only if stuck!)
6. Visualize in Python Tutor
7. Ask AI for more practice
```

### 3. Use the Tools
- 🎨 **Python Tutor**: Paste code to visualize execution
- 🤖 **AI Assistant**: Ask questions about concepts
- 📺 **Videos**: Check video-resources.md for tutorials
- 👥 **Study Group**: Discuss with classmates

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Notebook Won't Open in Colab
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try incognito/private browsing mode
3. Clear browser cache
4. Try a different browser

### Code Errors
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Check for typos
3. Paste error + code into AI assistant
4. Ask instructor during office hours

### Lost Your Work
- Colab auto-saves to Google Drive
- Check "File" > "Locate in Drive"
- Enable "Save a copy in Drive" for backup

---

## 🎨 Using Python Tutor

After running examples in the notebook:

1. **Copy the code** from any cell
2. **Go to** [pythontutor.com](https://pythontutor.com)
3. **Paste** the code
4. **Click** "Visualize Execution"
5. **Step through** to see what happens

**Best cells to visualize:**
- Any function calls (see call stack!)
- Loop examples (watch iteration)
- Data structure operations (see memory)
- Variable assignments (understand scope)
