# Data Querying with SQL: Your Gateway to Data Mastery

Welcome to the fascinating world of SQL! Imagine having a conversation with your data - that's exactly what SQL allows you to do. Whether you're analyzing customer behavior, tracking business metrics, or uncovering hidden patterns, SQL is your trusted companion in the data journey.

Think of SQL as a universal language for data - just like how English helps people from different countries communicate, SQL helps different systems and people work with data in a standardized way. It's like having a Swiss Army knife for data manipulation: one tool that can slice, dice, filter, combine, and analyze data in countless ways.

For example, with a single SQL query, you can:

- Find your top 10 customers by revenue
- Calculate month-over-month growth rates
- Identify products frequently bought together
- Track user engagement patterns
- Generate complex business reports

And the best part? The same SQL query will work whether you're dealing with 100 records or 100 million records!

Consider this real-world scenario:

```sql
-- A single query that provides valuable business insights
SELECT 
    c.customer_segment,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.customer_id) as num_customers,
    ROUND(AVG(o.total_amount), 2) as avg_order_value,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_revenue,
    COUNT(o.order_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT o.customer_id) as orders_per_customer
FROM orders o
JOIN customer_segments c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY c.customer_segment
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

/* Output:
customer_segment | num_customers | avg_order_value | total_revenue | orders_per_customer
----------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------------
Premium         | 1250          | 185.50          | 580,937.50    | 2.5
Standard        | 3500          | 75.25           | 395,062.50    | 1.5
Basic           | 5250          | 45.75           | 240,187.50    | 1.0
*/
```

This single query tells us:

- Which customer segments are most valuable
- Average spending patterns
- Customer engagement levels
- Revenue distribution

## Module Overview

### 1. Introduction to Databases

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Database] --> B[Tables]
    B --> C[Rows/Records]
    B --> D[Columns/Fields]
    A --> E[Relationships]
    E --> F[Primary Keys]
    E --> G[Foreign Keys]
    A --> H[Constraints]
    H --> I[Data Integrity]
    H --> J[Business Rules]
    B --> K[Indexes]
    K --> L[Performance]
```

Learn the building blocks of databases:

- **RDBMS Fundamentals**
  - PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle
  - Client-server architecture
  - ACID properties
  - Transaction management

- **Schema Design**
  - Normalization principles
  - Entity relationships
  - Data modeling best practices
  - Performance considerations

- **Data Types & Constraints**

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE products (
      product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      price DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (price >= 0),
      created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
      category_id INT REFERENCES categories(id)
  );
  ```

### 2. Basic SQL Operations

Master the fundamental operations with practical examples:

```sql
-- Find top-selling products this month
SELECT 
    p.product_name,
    SUM(oi.quantity) as units_sold,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price) as revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.customer_id) as unique_buyers
FROM products p
JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
WHERE o.order_date >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE)
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name
HAVING SUM(oi.quantity) > 0
ORDER BY units_sold DESC
LIMIT 5;

/* Output:
product_name    | units_sold | revenue  | unique_buyers
----------------|------------|----------|---------------
iPhone 13       | 250        | 250000   | 245
AirPods Pro     | 180        | 43200    | 178
MacBook Pro     | 75         | 150000   | 75
iPad Air        | 65         | 45500    | 63
Apple Watch     | 60         | 24000    | 58
*/
```

### 3. Aggregations and Grouping

Transform raw data into actionable insights:

```sql
-- Customer cohort analysis
WITH cohort_data AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('month', first_order_date) as cohort_month,
        COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as cohort_size,
        SUM(total_spent) as total_revenue,
        AVG(orders_count) as avg_orders
    FROM customer_metrics
    GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', first_order_date)
)
SELECT 
    cohort_month,
    cohort_size,
    ROUND(total_revenue/cohort_size, 2) as revenue_per_customer,
    ROUND(avg_orders, 1) as avg_orders_per_customer
FROM cohort_data
ORDER BY cohort_month DESC;
```

Performance consideration:
$T_{query} = O(n \log n)$ for sorted aggregations
$T_{memory} = O(k)$ where k = number of groups

### 4. Joins and Relationships

Master the art of combining data:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[INNER JOIN] --> B[Matching Records]
    C[LEFT JOIN] --> D[All Left + Matching Right]
    E[RIGHT JOIN] --> F[All Right + Matching Left]
    G[FULL JOIN] --> H[All Records]
```

Example of complex joins:

```sql
-- Customer order history with product details
WITH customer_orders AS (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_id,
        c.name as customer_name,
        o.order_id,
        o.order_date,
        p.product_name,
        oi.quantity,
        oi.price as unit_price,
        oi.quantity * oi.price as total_amount
    FROM customers c
    LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
    LEFT JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
)
SELECT 
    customer_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) as total_orders,
    SUM(total_amount) as total_spent,
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT product_name, ', ') as products_bought
FROM customer_orders
GROUP BY customer_id, customer_name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) > 0;
```

### 5. Advanced SQL Concepts

Take your SQL skills to the next level:

1. **Query Optimization**

   ```sql
   EXPLAIN ANALYZE
   SELECT /*+ INDEX(orders idx_order_date) */
       DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) as month,
       COUNT(*) as order_count,
       SUM(total_amount) as revenue
   FROM orders
   WHERE order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year'
   GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date);
   ```

2. **Window Functions**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       category_name,
       product_name,
       price,
       AVG(price) OVER (PARTITION BY category_name) as avg_category_price,
       price - AVG(price) OVER (PARTITION BY category_name) as price_diff_from_avg,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category_name ORDER BY price DESC) as price_rank
   FROM products p
   JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id;
   ```

3. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**

   ```sql
   WITH RECURSIVE subordinates AS (
       -- Base case: direct reports
       SELECT employee_id, manager_id, name, 1 as level
       FROM employees
       WHERE manager_id = 1
       
       UNION ALL
       
       -- Recursive case: subordinates of subordinates
       SELECT e.employee_id, e.manager_id, e.name, s.level + 1
       FROM employees e
       JOIN subordinates s ON e.manager_id = s.employee_id
   )
   SELECT * FROM subordinates ORDER BY level, employee_id;
   ```

Performance considerations:

- Query Cost = $I/O + CPU + Memory$
- Index Usage = $\frac{SelectivityFactor \times DataSize}{IndexSize}$
- Join Cost = $O(n \log n)$ for hash joins

   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Query Writing Standards**

   ```sql
   --  Bad Practice
   SELECT * FROM orders o, customers c WHERE o.customer_id=c.id;
   
   --  Good Practice
   SELECT 
       c.first_name,
       c.last_name,
       o.order_date,
       o.total_amount
   FROM orders o
   JOIN customers c 
       ON o.customer_id = c.id
   WHERE 
       o.order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
   ORDER BY 
       o.order_date DESC;
   ```

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Indexing Strategy**

     ```sql
     -- Create indexes for frequently queried columns
     CREATE INDEX idx_orders_date ON orders(order_date);
     CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer ON orders(customer_id);
     
     -- Use composite indexes for common query patterns
     CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_date 
     ON orders(customer_id, order_date);
     ```

   - **Query Optimization**

     ```sql
     --  Bad: Full table scan
     SELECT * FROM orders 
     WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) = 2023;
     
     --  Good: Uses index
     SELECT * FROM orders 
     WHERE order_date >= '2023-01-01' 
       AND order_date < '2024-01-01';
     ```

3. **Data Integrity**

   ```sql
   -- Use constraints to enforce business rules
   CREATE TABLE products (
       product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       price DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (price >= 0),
       stock INT CHECK (stock >= 0),
       category_id INT REFERENCES categories(id)
   );
   ```

4. **Code Organization**

   ```sql
   -- Use CTEs for complex queries
   WITH monthly_sales AS (
       SELECT 
           DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) as month,
           SUM(total_amount) as revenue
       FROM orders
       GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)
   ),
   sales_growth AS (
       SELECT 
           month,
           revenue,
           LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY month) as prev_month_revenue
       FROM monthly_sales
   )
   SELECT 
       month,
       revenue,
       ROUND(
           ((revenue - prev_month_revenue) / prev_month_revenue * 100)::numeric, 
           2
       ) as growth_rate
   FROM sales_growth;
   ```
