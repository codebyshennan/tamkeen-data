## Additional Real-World Business Scenarios üíº

### 1. E-commerce Order Analytics
```sql
-- Comprehensive order analysis with multiple metrics
WITH order_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('day', order_date) as order_day,
        COUNT(*) as total_orders,
        COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as unique_customers,
        SUM(total_amount) as revenue,
        AVG(total_amount) as avg_order_value,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE 
            WHEN customer_id NOT IN (
                SELECT customer_id 
                FROM orders o2 
                WHERE o2.order_date < o.order_date
            ) THEN customer_id 
        END) as new_customers
    FROM orders o
    WHERE order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
    GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', order_date)
)
SELECT 
    order_day,
    total_orders,
    unique_customers,
    ROUND(revenue::numeric, 2) as revenue,
    ROUND(avg_order_value::numeric, 2) as aov,
    new_customers,
    ROUND(
        (new_customers::float / NULLIF(unique_customers, 0) * 100)::numeric,
        2
    ) as new_customer_percentage,
    ROUND(
        (revenue::float / NULLIF(unique_customers, 0))::numeric,
        2
    ) as revenue_per_customer
FROM order_metrics
ORDER BY order_day DESC;
```

### 2. Customer Segmentation
```sql
WITH customer_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_id,
        c.email,
        COUNT(o.order_id) as order_count,
        SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent,
        MAX(o.order_date) as last_order_date,
        MIN(o.order_date) as first_order_date,
        COUNT(DISTINCT DATE_TRUNC('month', o.order_date)) as active_months,
        AVG(o.total_amount) as avg_order_value
    FROM customers c
    LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.email
)
SELECT 
    email,
    order_count,
    ROUND(total_spent::numeric, 2) as total_spent,
    last_order_date,
    first_order_date,
    active_months,
    ROUND(avg_order_value::numeric, 2) as avg_order_value,
    CASE 
        WHEN order_count = 0 THEN 'Never Ordered'
        WHEN last_order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days' THEN 'Active'
        WHEN last_order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days' THEN 'At Risk'
        ELSE 'Churned'
    END as customer_status,
    CASE 
        WHEN total_spent >= 1000 AND order_count >= 10 THEN 'VIP'
        WHEN total_spent >= 500 OR order_count >= 5 THEN 'Regular'
        WHEN order_count > 0 THEN 'New'
        ELSE 'Inactive'
    END as customer_segment
FROM customer_metrics
ORDER BY total_spent DESC NULLS LAST;
```

### 3. Product Performance
```sql
WITH product_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        p.product_id,
        p.name,
        p.category,
        p.price,
        COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) as order_count,
        SUM(oi.quantity) as units_sold,
        SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price_at_time) as revenue,
        COUNT(DISTINCT o.customer_id) as customer_count,
        AVG(r.rating) as avg_rating,
        COUNT(r.review_id) as review_count
    FROM products p
    LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
    LEFT JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
    LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.product_id = r.product_id
    GROUP BY p.product_id, p.name, p.category, p.price
)
SELECT 
    name,
    category,
    price,
    order_count,
    units_sold,
    ROUND(revenue::numeric, 2) as revenue,
    customer_count,
    ROUND(avg_rating::numeric, 2) as avg_rating,
    review_count,
    ROUND(
        (revenue / NULLIF(units_sold, 0))::numeric,
        2
    ) as avg_selling_price,
    ROUND(
        (units_sold::float / NULLIF(customer_count, 0))::numeric,
        2
    ) as units_per_customer
FROM product_metrics
ORDER BY revenue DESC NULLS LAST;
```

## Performance Optimization Examples üöÄ

### 1. Index Usage
```sql
-- Create strategic indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_date 
ON orders(customer_id, order_date DESC);

CREATE INDEX idx_products_category_price 
ON products(category_id, price)
INCLUDE (name, stock_quantity);

-- Use indexes effectively
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    c.name,
    COUNT(*) as order_count,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE 
    o.order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
    AND o.total_amount > 100
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name;
```

### 2. Query Optimization
```sql
-- Bad: Inefficient subquery
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE customer_id IN (
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM customers
    WHERE status = 'active'
);

-- Good: Use JOIN
SELECT o.*
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE c.status = 'active';

-- Better: Use EXISTS
SELECT o.*
FROM orders o
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM customers c
    WHERE c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    AND c.status = 'active'
);
```

### 3. Batch Processing
```sql
-- Process large datasets in batches
DO $$
DECLARE
    batch_size INT := 1000;
    total_processed INT := 0;
    batch_count INT := 0;
BEGIN
    LOOP
        WITH batch AS (
            SELECT order_id
            FROM orders
            WHERE processed = false
            ORDER BY order_date
            LIMIT batch_size
            FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
        )
        UPDATE orders o
        SET processed = true
        FROM batch b
        WHERE o.order_id = b.order_id;
        
        GET DIAGNOSTICS batch_count = ROW_COUNT;
        
        EXIT WHEN batch_count = 0;
        
        total_processed := total_processed + batch_count;
        RAISE NOTICE 'Processed % orders', total_processed;
        
        COMMIT;
    END LOOP;
END $$;
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 1. N+1 Query Problem
```sql
-- Bad: Separate query for each order
SELECT o.order_id, 
       (SELECT c.name FROM customers c WHERE c.id = o.customer_id) as customer_name
FROM orders o;

-- Good: Single JOIN query
SELECT o.order_id, c.name as customer_name
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```

### 2. Cartesian Products
```sql
-- Bad: Implicit cross join
SELECT * FROM orders, customers 
WHERE orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;

-- Good: Explicit JOIN syntax
SELECT * FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```

### 3. NULL Handling
```sql
-- Bad: NULL comparison
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price = NULL;

-- Good: IS NULL operator
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price IS NULL;

-- Better: COALESCE for default values
SELECT 
    product_id,
    name,
    COALESCE(price, 0) as price,
    COALESCE(description, 'No description available') as description
FROM products;
```

## Best Practices Checklist ‚úÖ

1. **Query Structure**
   - Use meaningful table aliases
   - Format queries for readability
   - Comment complex logic
   - Use CTEs for better organization

2. **Performance**
   - Create appropriate indexes
   - Filter early in the query
   - Avoid SELECT *
   - Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE

3. **Data Quality**
   - Handle NULL values appropriately
   - Validate input data
   - Use constraints
   - Implement error handling

4. **Maintenance**
   - Document queries
   - Use version control
   - Monitor performance
   - Regular optimization

Remember: "Clean, efficient queries lead to better performance and maintainability!" üí™
