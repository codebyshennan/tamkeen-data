# Quiz: Data Wrangling

## Questions

1. What is data cleaning?
   a. Collecting data
   b. Analyzing data
   _c. Fixing or removing incorrect data_
   d. Visualizing data

**Explanation**: Data cleaning is the crucial first step in the data preparation process. It involves:
- Identifying and correcting errors in datasets
- Handling missing or incomplete data
- Removing duplicate records
- Standardizing formats and units
- Dealing with outliers
This process ensures data quality and reliability for subsequent analysis. Poor data quality can lead to incorrect conclusions and decisions.

2. Which of these is NOT a common data quality issue?
   a. Missing values
   b. Duplicate records
   c. Inconsistent formats
   _d. Beautiful visualization_

**Explanation**: Beautiful visualization is not a data quality issue - it's related to data presentation. Common data quality issues include:
- Missing values: Gaps in the dataset
- Duplicate records: Repeated entries that can skew analysis
- Inconsistent formats: Like different date formats or units
These issues affect data integrity and must be addressed before analysis.

3. What is the best way to handle missing values?
   a. Always delete rows with missing values
   b. Always replace with zero
   _c. Choose method based on context and data_
   d. Ignore them

**Explanation**: The appropriate method for handling missing values depends on several factors:
- The type of data
- The amount of missing data
- The pattern of missingness
- The impact on analysis
Methods include:
- Deletion (when data is missing completely at random)
- Mean/median imputation (for numeric data)
- Mode imputation (for categorical data)
- Advanced methods like regression or multiple imputation

4. What is data transformation?
   _a. Converting data from one format to another_
   b. Deleting incorrect data
   c. Collecting new data
   d. Analyzing data patterns

**Explanation**: Data transformation involves changing the form or structure of data while preserving its meaning. Common transformations include:
- Normalization/Standardization
- Log transformations
- One-hot encoding
- Binning/Discretization
These transformations prepare data for analysis or modeling by making it more suitable for specific techniques.

5. Which scaling method preserves zero values and is robust to outliers?
   a. Standard scaling
   _b. Robust scaling_
   c. Min-max scaling
   d. Log transformation

**Explanation**: Robust scaling (also known as robust standardization) uses statistics that are robust to outliers:
- Uses median instead of mean
- Uses interquartile range (IQR) instead of standard deviation
- Preserves zero values
- Less influenced by extreme values
This makes it particularly useful for datasets with outliers or skewed distributions.
