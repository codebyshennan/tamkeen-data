   d. Beautiful data visualization

8. What is the best approach for handling missing values?
   a. Always delete rows with missing values
   b. Always replace with zero
   c. Choose method based on context and data patterns
   d. Ignore them completely

9. What is data transformation?
   a. Converting data from one format or structure to another
   b. Deleting incorrect data entries
   c. Collecting new data samples
   d. Analyzing data patterns

10. Which scaling method is most robust to outliers?

    b. Robust scaling (using quartiles)
    c. Min-max scaling
    d. Log transformation

## Exploratory Data Analysis (25 points)
