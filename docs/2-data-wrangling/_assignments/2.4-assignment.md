# Quiz: Data Engineering

## Questions

1. What is ETL?
   _a. Extract, Transform, Load_
   b. Export, Transfer, Link
   c. Evaluate, Test, Launch
   d. Extract, Test, Load

**Explanation**: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is a fundamental data engineering process that:
- Extract: Retrieves data from various source systems
- Transform: Converts data into a suitable format and structure
- Load: Stores the processed data in a target system
This process is crucial for:
- Data integration
- Data warehouse population
- Data quality assurance
- Business intelligence support

2. Which storage format is best for structured data?
   a. Text files
   _b. Relational databases_
   c. PDF files
   d. Image files

**Explanation**: Relational databases are optimal for structured data because they:
- Enforce data integrity through schemas
- Support complex queries through SQL
- Provide ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- Enable efficient indexing and retrieval
- Support relationships between different data entities
Other formats serve different purposes:
- Text files: Simple data storage
- PDF files: Document storage
- Image files: Visual data storage

3. What is data integration?
   _a. Combining data from different sources_
   b. Cleaning data
   c. Analyzing data
   d. Visualizing data

**Explanation**: Data integration is the process of:
- Combining data from multiple sources
- Ensuring consistency across integrated data
- Resolving conflicts and duplications
- Creating a unified view of the data
- Maintaining data lineage
This is essential for:
- Creating comprehensive datasets
- Supporting business intelligence
- Enabling advanced analytics
- Ensuring data consistency across systems

4. Which is NOT a common data storage system?
   a. MySQL
   b. PostgreSQL
   c. MongoDB
   _d. Microsoft Word_

**Explanation**: Microsoft Word is a word processor, not a data storage system. Common data storage systems include:
- Relational Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
  - Structured data storage
  - SQL query support
  - ACID compliance
- NoSQL Databases (MongoDB)
  - Flexible schema
  - Horizontal scaling
  - Various data models (document, key-value, etc.)
These systems are designed specifically for efficient data storage and retrieval.

5. What is the purpose of data warehousing?
   _a. To store integrated data for analysis_
   b. To collect new data
   c. To clean data
   d. To visualize data

**Explanation**: Data warehousing serves to:
- Centralize data from multiple sources
- Optimize data for analysis and reporting
- Maintain historical data
- Support business intelligence
- Enable complex analytical queries
Key characteristics include:
- Subject-oriented organization
- Integrated data from various sources
- Time-variant (historical) data
- Non-volatile storage
