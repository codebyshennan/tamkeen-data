# Quiz: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Questions

1. What is the main purpose of EDA?
   _a. To understand patterns and relationships in data_
   b. To clean data
   c. To collect data
   d. To make predictions

**Explanation**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical first step in data analysis that:
- Helps identify patterns, trends, and relationships in data
- Reveals potential anomalies or outliers
- Suggests hypotheses for further investigation
- Informs the choice of statistical methods
- Provides insights that guide more complex analyses
This systematic exploration helps analysts understand the fundamental characteristics of their dataset before proceeding with more advanced analyses.

2. Which plot is best for showing the distribution of a continuous variable?
   a. Bar plot
   b. Scatter plot
   _c. Histogram_
   d. Pie chart

**Explanation**: A histogram is ideal for continuous variables because it:
- Shows the frequency distribution of values
- Reveals the shape of the distribution (normal, skewed, bimodal, etc.)
- Helps identify outliers and gaps in the data
- Makes it easy to see central tendency and spread
Other plots serve different purposes:
- Bar plots are for categorical data
- Scatter plots show relationships between two variables
- Pie charts show proportions of a whole

3. What does a box plot show?
   a. Only the median
   _b. Five-number summary and outliers_
   c. Just the outliers
   d. Mean and standard deviation

**Explanation**: A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) provides a comprehensive view of the data's distribution by showing:
- Median (middle line)
- First quartile (Q1, bottom of box)
- Third quartile (Q3, top of box)
- Minimum and maximum within 1.5 Ã— IQR (whiskers)
- Individual points for outliers
This makes it excellent for comparing distributions and identifying outliers.

4. Which correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1?
   _a. Pearson_
   b. Chi-square
   c. F-statistic
   d. T-statistic

**Explanation**: The Pearson correlation coefficient:
- Ranges from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to +1 (perfect positive correlation)
- 0 indicates no linear correlation
- Measures the strength and direction of linear relationships
- Is widely used in statistical analysis
Other statistics mentioned serve different purposes:
- Chi-square tests categorical variable independence
- F-statistic compares variances
- T-statistic compares means

5. What type of plot is best for showing relationships between two continuous variables?
   _a. Scatter plot_
   b. Bar plot
   c. Line plot
   d. Pie chart

**Explanation**: A scatter plot is ideal for showing relationships between two continuous variables because it:
- Shows the pattern of relationship (linear, curved, none)
- Reveals the strength of the relationship
- Helps identify outliers
- Can show clustering or grouping
- Can be enhanced with trend lines or confidence intervals
Other plots are better suited for different purposes:
- Bar plots for categorical data
- Line plots for time series
- Pie charts for proportions
