# Quiz: SQL Fundamentals

## Questions

1. Which SQL command is used to retrieve data from a database?
   _a. SELECT_
   b. UPDATE
   c. INSERT
   d. DELETE

**Explanation**: The SELECT statement is the fundamental command for retrieving data from a database. It allows you to specify exactly which columns you want to retrieve and from which tables. While UPDATE modifies existing records, INSERT adds new records, and DELETE removes records, SELECT is specifically designed for data retrieval operations.

2. What is the purpose of the WHERE clause?
   a. To sort data
   b. To group data
   _c. To filter data_
   d. To join tables

**Explanation**: The WHERE clause is used to filter records based on specified conditions. It acts like a filter that only allows rows meeting certain criteria to be included in the result set. For example, `WHERE age > 18` would only return records where the age column contains values greater than 18. This is different from sorting (ORDER BY), grouping (GROUP BY), or joining tables (JOIN).

3. Which JOIN type returns all records from both tables?
   a. INNER JOIN
   _b. FULL OUTER JOIN_
   c. LEFT JOIN
   d. RIGHT JOIN

**Explanation**: A FULL OUTER JOIN returns all records from both tables, matching records where possible and filling with NULL values where there is no match. This is different from:
- INNER JOIN: Only returns matching records
- LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table and matching from right
- RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table and matching from left

4. What is the purpose of GROUP BY?
   a. To sort records
   _b. To group rows with similar values_
   c. To filter records
   d. To join tables

**Explanation**: `GROUP BY` is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. It's typically used with aggregate functions (like `COUNT`, SUM, AVG) to perform calculations on each group rather than the entire table. For example, you might use GROUP BY to find the average salary per department or the total sales per region.

5. Which aggregate function returns the number of rows?
   a. SUM
   b. AVG
   _c. COUNT_
   d. MAX

**Explanation**: COUNT is an aggregate function that returns the number of rows that match a specified criteria. While:
- SUM adds up numeric values
- AVG calculates the mean of numeric values
- MAX finds the highest value
COUNT specifically deals with counting rows, making it essential for tasks like finding the number of customers, products, or transactions.
