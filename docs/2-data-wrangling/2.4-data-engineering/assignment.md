# Data Engineering Assessment

This comprehensive assessment will test your understanding of data engineering concepts, practices, and implementations.

## Part 1: Conceptual Understanding üß†

### Multiple Choice Questions (2 points each)

1. What is ETL in data engineering?
   a. Extract, Transform, Load
   b. Export, Transfer, Link
   c. Evaluate, Test, Launch
   d. Extract, Test, Load
   
   **Explanation**: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is a fundamental data pipeline process where data is:
   - Extracted from source systems
   - Transformed to meet business needs
   - Loaded into target systems

2. Which storage solution is most appropriate for structured, relational data with ACID requirements?
   a. Text files
   b. Relational databases
   c. PDF files
   d. Image files
   
   **Explanation**: Relational databases are ideal for structured data because they:
   - Enforce data integrity
   - Support complex queries
   - Provide ACID compliance
   - Enable efficient indexing

3. What is the primary purpose of data integration?
   a. Combining data from different sources
   b. Cleaning data
   c. Analyzing data
   d. Visualizing data
   
   **Explanation**: Data integration involves:
   - Merging multiple data sources
   - Resolving schema conflicts
   - Ensuring data consistency
   - Creating unified views

4. Which is NOT typically used as a data storage system?
   a. MySQL
   b. PostgreSQL
   c. MongoDB
   d. Microsoft Word
   
   **Explanation**: While MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB are purpose-built databases:
   - MySQL: Relational database
   - PostgreSQL: Advanced relational database
   - MongoDB: NoSQL document store
   - Microsoft Word: Word processor, not designed for data storage

5. What is the primary purpose of data warehousing?
   a. To store integrated data for analysis
   b. To collect new data
   c. To clean data
   d. To visualize data
   
   **Explanation**: Data warehouses are designed to:
   - Centralize enterprise data
   - Support complex analytics
   - Maintain historical records
   - Enable business intelligence

### Short Answer Questions (5 points each)

6. Explain the difference between batch processing and stream processing in data engineering.
   
   **Expected Answer**: Your explanation should cover:
   - Batch Processing:
     * Processes data in groups
     * Scheduled intervals
     * Higher latency
     * Better for large volumes
   
   - Stream Processing:
     * Processes data in real-time
     * Continuous processing
     * Lower latency
     * Better for immediate insights

7. Describe three common data quality issues and how to address them.
   
   **Expected Answer**: Examples include:
   - Missing Values:
     * Detection methods
     * Imputation strategies
     * Prevention techniques
   
   - Duplicate Records:
     * Identification approaches
     * Deduplication methods
     * Prevention mechanisms
   
   - Inconsistent Formats:
     * Standardization techniques
     * Validation rules
     * Data cleansing approaches

## Part 2: Practical Implementation üõ†Ô∏è

### Coding Exercise (15 points)

8. Implement a simple ETL pipeline in Python that:
   - Reads data from a CSV file
   - Performs data cleaning and transformation
   - Loads data into a SQLite database

```python
# Template
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
from datetime import datetime

def extract_data(file_path):
    """
    Extract data from CSV file
    """
    # Your code here
    pass

def transform_data(df):
    """
    Clean and transform the data
    """
    # Your code here
    pass

def load_data(df, db_path, table_name):
    """
    Load data into SQLite database
    """
    # Your code here
    pass

def run_pipeline(input_file, db_path, table_name):
    """
    Execute the complete ETL pipeline
    """
    try:
        # Extract
        df = extract_data(input_file)
        
        # Transform
        df_transformed = transform_data(df)
        
        # Load
        load_data(df_transformed, db_path, table_name)
        
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Pipeline failed: {str(e)}")
        return False
```

### System Design Exercise (10 points)

9. Design a data pipeline architecture for an e-commerce platform that:
   - Processes real-time order data
   - Updates inventory levels
   - Generates sales reports
   - Handles peak load during sales events

   **Expected Deliverables**:
   - Architecture diagram
   - Component descriptions
   - Data flow explanation
   - Scaling considerations

## Part 3: Problem Solving ü§î

### Case Study Analysis (10 points)

10. Analyze the following scenario:
    
    A retail company wants to implement a real-time recommendation system using customer purchase history and browsing behavior. They currently have:
    - Batch-processed sales data
    - Real-time clickstream data
    - Customer profile database
    
    Propose a data engineering solution that addresses:
    - Data integration strategy
    - Processing architecture
    - Storage solutions
    - Performance considerations
