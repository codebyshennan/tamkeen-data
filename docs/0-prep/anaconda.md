# Anaconda Setup

## What is Anaconda?

Anaconda is a **free** Python distribution that comes with Python and hundreds of pre-installed data science packages. Think of it as a "starter kit" for data science - everything you need is already included!

**In simple terms:** Instead of installing Python and then installing dozens of packages one by one, Anaconda gives you everything in one package. It also includes a visual tool (Anaconda Navigator) that lets you manage everything with clicks instead of typing commands.

**Why use Anaconda?**
- ✅ **Beginner-friendly** - Visual interface (Anaconda Navigator) for managing packages
- ✅ **Pre-installed packages** - Popular data science tools ready to use
- ✅ **Easy environment management** - Create separate workspaces for different projects
- ✅ **Includes Jupyter Notebook** - Ready to use for data analysis
- ✅ **Well-supported** - Great documentation and community

## What is `uv`?

`uv` is a modern, super-fast Python package manager. It's like a turbocharged version of `pip` - it installs packages 10-100 times faster!

**When to use `uv`:**
- You're comfortable with command-line tools
- You want faster package installation
- You prefer lightweight tools
- You're working on multiple projects

## Which Should I Choose?

**Choose Anaconda if:**
- You're a beginner
- You prefer visual tools (GUI)
- You want everything pre-installed
- You want the easiest setup experience

**Choose `uv` if:**
- You're comfortable with command-line
- You want faster package installation
- You prefer lightweight tools
- You're an experienced developer

> **Tip for beginners:** Start with Anaconda! You can always learn `uv` later. This guide covers both options.

## Option 1: Anaconda

### Why Anaconda?

If you see a version number, congratulations - Anaconda is installed! 🎉

> **Troubleshooting:** If you see "command not found", try restarting Terminal or your computer.

</details>

### Package Installation

**What is an environment?** Think of it as a separate workspace for your project. Each environment has its own set of packages, so you can have different versions for different projects without conflicts.

**Step 1: Open Terminal/Anaconda Prompt**

- **Windows:** Open "Anaconda Prompt" from the Start menu (search for "Anaconda Prompt")
- **macOS:** Open Terminal (Applications → Utilities → Terminal)

**Step 2: Create Your First Environment**

```bash
# Create a new environment named "dsai" with Python 3.10
# This will take a minute or two
conda create -n dsai python=3.10
```

When prompted, type `y` and press Enter to proceed.

**Step 3: Activate Your Environment**

```bash
# Activate the environment (you'll see "(dsai)" appear in your prompt)
conda activate dsai
```

> **What just happened?** You created a fresh workspace and activated it. Notice your prompt now shows `(dsai)` - that means you're working in that environment!

**Step 4: Install Essential Packages**

```bash
# Install core data science packages
# This will take several minutes - grab a coffee!
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels jupyter

# Install additional packages (if needed for your course)
conda install -c conda-forge apache-airflow
```

When prompted, type `y` and press Enter for each installation.

> **Tip:** You can install packages one at a time, but installing them together is faster and helps avoid conflicts.

### Environment Management

```bash
# List all environments
conda env list

# Export environment
conda env export > environment.yml

# Create environment from file
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Remove environment
conda env remove -n environment_name
```

## Launching Tools

### Anaconda Navigator (Anaconda only)

Anaconda Navigator is a visual tool that lets you launch applications and manage packages with clicks instead of commands.

**How to Open:**
- **Windows:** Start menu → Search "Anaconda Navigator" → Click it
- **macOS:** Launchpad → Search "Anaconda Navigator" → Click it

![Anaconda Navigator Interface Placeholder - Shows the Navigator with available applications]

**What you'll see:**
- A list of applications you can launch (Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, etc.)
- Package management tools
- Environment management

### Jupyter Notebook

**Method 1: Using Anaconda Navigator (Easiest for Beginners)**

1. Open Anaconda Navigator
2. Find "Jupyter Notebook" in the list
3. Click the **"Launch"** button below it
4. Your web browser will open automatically with Jupyter Notebook

![Jupyter Launch in Navigator Placeholder - Shows clicking Launch button]

**Method 2: Using Terminal/Command Prompt**

1. Open Terminal (macOS) or Anaconda Prompt (Windows)
2. Make sure your environment is activated (you should see `(dsai)` in the prompt)
3. Type: `jupyter notebook` and press Enter
4. Your default browser will open with Jupyter Notebook

> **Tip:** If you see a URL like `http://localhost:8888`, that's normal - Jupyter is running on your computer!

### VS Code

**Using Anaconda Navigator:**

1. Open Anaconda Navigator
2. Find "VS Code" in the list
3. Click the **"Launch"** button
4. VS Code will open

> **Note:** If VS Code isn't listed, you may need to install it separately. See the VS Code setup guide for details.

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Anaconda Issues

1. **PATH Issues**:
   * Windows: Restart your computer
   * macOS: Run `source ~/.bash_profile` or restart Terminal
2.  **Package Conflicts**:

    ```bash
    # Remove conflicting package
    conda remove package_name

    # Reinstall with specific version
    conda install package_name=version
    ```
3. **Environment Activation Fails**:
   * Windows: Run as Administrator
   * macOS: Check `conda init` was run
4.  **Jupyter Notebook Kernel Missing**:

    ```bash
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=dsai
    ```

## Option 2: `uv`

### Why `uv`?

[`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a modern Python package manager created by Astral (the team behind Ruff). It's designed to be **10-100 times faster** than traditional `pip`!

**Key Benefits:**
- ⚡ **Super fast** - Installs packages much faster than pip
- 🎯 **Better dependency resolution** - Handles package conflicts automatically
- 📦 **Lightweight** - Smaller footprint than Anaconda
- 🔧 **All-in-one tool** - Replaces multiple tools (pip, venv, pip-tools, etc.)
- ✅ **Compatible** - Works with `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`

**Who should use `uv`?**
- Developers comfortable with command-line tools
- People who want faster package installation
- Those who prefer lightweight tools
- Experienced Python developers

### Installation

> **Time needed:** Less than 2 minutes

**Step 1: Install `uv`**

Open your terminal and run the command for your operating system:

**For macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**For Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Step 2: Verify Installation**

Close and reopen your terminal, then type:
```bash
uv --version
```

You should see a version number like `uv 0.x.x`. If you do, you're all set! 🎉

> **Troubleshooting:** If the command isn't found, you may need to restart your terminal or add `uv` to your PATH. Check the [uv documentation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for platform-specific instructions.

### Usage

**Step 1: Create a New Environment**

Navigate to your project folder, then:

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment
# This creates a folder called ".venv" in your current directory
uv venv
```

**Step 2: Activate the Environment**

```bash
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

You should see `(.venv)` appear in your terminal prompt - that means the environment is active!

**Step 3: Install Packages**

```bash
# Install all essential data science packages
# This is much faster than pip!
uv pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels jupyter apache-airflow
```

> **Tip:** You can install packages one at a time, or all together like above. `uv` will handle any conflicts automatically.

### `uv` Issues

1. **Installation Fails**:
   * Check Python version compatibility
   * Ensure build tools are installed
2.  **Package Conflicts**:

    ```bash
    # Clean install
    uv pip install --clean package_name
    ```
3. **Environment Issues**:
   * Delete `.venv` and recreate
   * Check `PATH` settings

### General Tips

1. **Slow Package Installation**:
   * Use faster package mirrors
   * For Anaconda: `conda config --add channels conda-forge`
   * For uv: Use `uv pip install --cache-dir=.cache`
2. **Memory Issues**:
   * Close unnecessary applications
   * For large packages, try installing one at a time
3. **Version Conflicts**:
   * Create a new environment for different projects
   * Use `conda list` or `pip list` to check installed versions
4. **Jupyter Integration**:
   * Ensure kernels are properly registered
   * Check kernel paths match environment paths
