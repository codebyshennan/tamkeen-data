    - For data engineering workflows

## Setup Order (Recommended)

**Week 1 - Essential Setup:**
1. Install Anaconda (or set up `uv`)
2. Install Python data science libraries
3. Test Jupyter Notebook
4. Install VS Code (optional but recommended)

**Week 2-3 - As Needed:**
- Install DBeaver when you start SQL lessons
- Set up Tableau when you reach visualization modules
- Create Snowflake account for advanced SQL
- Set up Databricks for big data topics
- Install Airflow for data engineering projects

## Getting Help

### If You Get Stuck

1. **Check the troubleshooting section** in each guide
2. **Review the "Common Issues"** section
3. **Ask during office hours** (see [Pedagogy Guide](./pedagogy.md))
4. **Check the documentation** links in each guide

### Common First-Time Issues

- **"Command not found"** - Usually means the tool isn't in your PATH. Try restarting your terminal.
- **Installation takes forever** - This is normal! Some packages are large. Be patient.
- **Permission errors** - On macOS/Linux, you might need to use `sudo` (but be careful!)
- **Can't find Python** - Make sure you installed Anaconda or Python first
