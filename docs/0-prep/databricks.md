# Getting Started with Databricks Community Edition

Databricks Community Edition is a free version of Databricks that provides a collaborative environment for data science and machine learning. It includes access to basic Databricks features and a small cluster for learning and experimentation.

## System Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Stable internet connection
- No software installation required (cloud-based)
- GitHub account (for authentication)

## Key Features

- Interactive notebooks (supporting Python, SQL, R, and Scala)
- Small single-node cluster for computation
- Built-in libraries and tools
- Sample datasets and notebooks
- Integration with popular ML frameworks

## Account Setup

1. Visit [Databricks Community Edition](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/login.html)
2. Click "Get Started With Community Edition"
3. Sign up using:
   - GitHub account (recommended)
   - Email address
4. Complete registration form
5. Verify email address
6. Accept terms of service

## Initial Configuration

### Workspace Setup

1. Create a new workspace:
   - Click "Create" in the sidebar
   - Choose "Notebook"
   - Select Python as the default language
   - Name your notebook

2. Create a cluster:
   - Click "Compute" in the sidebar
   - Click "Create Cluster"
   - Use default settings for Community Edition
   - Name your cluster
   - Click "Create Cluster"

### Importing Libraries

Common data science libraries are pre-installed. Import them in your notebook:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.ml import Pipeline
```

## Best Practices

### Workspace Organization

1. **Project Structure**:
   ```
   Workspace/
   ├── Shared/
   │   ├── Projects/
   │   └── Libraries/
   └── Users/
       └── your.email@domain.com/
           ├── Project1/
           └── Project2/
   ```

2. **Notebook Management**:
   - Use meaningful names
   - Add descriptions
   - Regular checkpoints
   - Version control integration

### Performance Optimization

1. **Cluster Usage**:
   - Start cluster before use
   - Stop when not in use
   - Monitor cluster health

2. **Code Efficiency**:
   - Use Spark DataFrame operations
   - Minimize data movement
   - Cache frequently used data

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Connection Problems

1. **Cluster Not Starting**:
   - Check quota limits
   - Verify cluster configuration
   - Restart browser
   - Clear browser cache

2. **Notebook Not Connecting**:
   - Ensure cluster is running
   - Detach and reattach notebook
   - Restart cluster

### Runtime Issues

1. **Out of Memory**:
   - Reduce data size
   - Optimize queries
   - Clear notebook state

2. **Slow Performance**:
   - Check network connection
   - Optimize code
   - Monitor cluster metrics

## Tips for Success

1. **Learning Resources**:
   - Complete quickstart tutorials
   - Review sample notebooks
   - Join community forums

2. **Development Workflow**:
   - Use notebook cells effectively
   - Document your code
   - Regular commits to version control

3. **Data Management**:
   - Upload data through UI
   - Use DBFS for storage
   - Implement proper cleanup
