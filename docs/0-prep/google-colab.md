# Getting Started with Google Colab

Google Colab (short for Colaboratory) is a free, cloud-based platform that allows you to write and execute Python code through your browser. It's particularly well-suited for machine learning, data analysis, and education.

## System Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome recommended)
- Google account
- Stable internet connection
- No local installation required

## Key Features

- Free access to GPUs and TPUs
- Pre-installed data science libraries
- Integration with Google Drive
- Real-time collaboration
- Markdown and code cells
- File upload/download capabilities
- GitHub integration

## Account Setup

1. Visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Accept terms of service
4. Create a new notebook or open an example

## Initial Configuration

### Creating a New Notebook

1. Go to File → New Notebook, or
2. Click "+ New Notebook" on the welcome page

### Basic Setup

1. Rename your notebook:
   - Click on "Untitled0.ipynb"
   - Enter a descriptive name

2. Configure runtime:
   - Runtime → Change runtime type
   - Choose Python version
   - Select hardware accelerator (None/GPU/TPU)

### Mounting Google Drive

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

## Best Practices

### Resource Management

1. **Runtime Management**:
   - Use `Runtime → Disconnect and delete runtime` when done
   - Be aware of idle timeouts (90 minutes)
   - Save work frequently

2. **Storage**:
   - Keep notebooks in Google Drive
   - Use `/content` for temporary files
   - Download important results

### Code Organization

1. **Cell Structure**:
   - Use markdown cells for documentation
   - Keep code cells focused and modular
   - Include cell outputs in saved notebooks

2. **Package Management**:
   ```python
   # Install additional packages
   !pip install package_name
   
   # Restart runtime after installation
   import sys
   sys.restart()
   ```

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Connection Problems

1. **Runtime Disconnects**:
   - Check internet connection
   - Reduce idle time
   - Save work frequently
   - Reconnect manually

2. **Resource Limits**:
   - Monitor RAM usage
   - Clear output cells
   - Restart runtime
   - Use smaller datasets

### Performance Issues

1. **Slow Execution**:
   - Check resource usage
   - Clear unnecessary outputs
   - Optimize code
   - Consider GPU runtime

2. **Memory Errors**:
   - Reduce data size
   - Use batch processing
   - Clear variables
   - Restart runtime

## Tips for Success

1. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - `Ctrl+Enter`: Run cell
   - `Shift+Enter`: Run cell and select below
   - `Alt+Enter`: Run cell and insert below
   - `Ctrl+M B`: Insert cell below
   - `Ctrl+M A`: Insert cell above
   - `Ctrl+M D`: Delete cell

2. **File Management**:
   ```python
   # Upload files
   from google.colab import files
   uploaded = files.upload()
   
   # Download files
   files.download('filename.ext')
   ```

3. **Collaboration**:
   - Share notebooks via link
   - Control access permissions
   - Use comments for feedback
   - Enable real-time collaboration
