# Teaching Pedagogy

This bootcamp follows a flipped classroom model with weekly office hours to provide an effective and flexible learning experience for students.

## Flipped Classroom Model

### What is a Flipped Classroom?

A flipped classroom inverts traditional teaching methods by:
- Delivering instructional content outside of class time
- Using class time for practical application and discussion
- Emphasizing active learning and problem-solving
- Allowing students to learn at their own pace

### How it Works

1. **Before Class**
   - Students review prepared materials:
     - Reading assignments
     - Pre-recorded video lectures
     - Interactive tutorials
     - Setup guides and documentation
   - Complete initial exercises to identify areas needing clarification

2. **During Class**
   - Focus on hands-on activities:
     - Practical coding exercises
     - Group projects
     - Problem-solving sessions
     - Code reviews
   - Direct application of concepts
   - Collaborative learning opportunities

3. **After Class**
   - Work on assignments
   - Review additional resources
   - Prepare questions for office hours
   - Engage in self-paced learning
