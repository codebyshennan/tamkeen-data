# Teaching Pedagogy

## How This Course Works

Welcome! This bootcamp uses a **flipped classroom** approach combined with weekly office hours. This means you'll learn at your own pace, and we'll use class time for hands-on practice and getting help.

**What does this mean for you?**
- 📚 You'll review materials **before** class (at your own pace)
- 💻 Class time is for **practical work** and **getting help**
- 🎯 You can **ask questions** during weekly office hours
- ⏰ **Flexible schedule** - learn when it works for you

> **Don't worry if this is new to you!** This approach actually makes learning easier because you can review materials as many times as you need, and class time is focused on actually doing the work.

## Flipped Classroom Model

### What is a Flipped Classroom?

**Traditional Classroom:**
- Teacher lectures in class
- Students do homework alone at home
- Limited time for questions

**Flipped Classroom (Our Approach):**
- You watch/read materials at home (your pace!)
- Class time is for hands-on practice and help
- More time for questions and collaboration
- Learn at your own speed

**In simple terms:** Instead of listening to lectures in class and struggling with homework alone, you'll review materials on your own time, then come to class ready to practice and get help!
