Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight but powerful source code editor that runs on your desktop. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js, and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages including Python.

> **Note:** This guide assumes you have Anaconda installed on your system. If not, please refer to the `Getting Started with Anaconda` before proceeding.

## Setting Up Python in VS Code

1. Install the Python extension:
   * Open VS Code
   * Click on the Extensions icon in the sidebar
   * Search for "Python"
   * Install the Microsoft Python extension
2. Configure Anaconda Integration:
   * If you have Anaconda installed, VS Code should automatically detect it
   * To verify your Python interpreter:
     * Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS)
     * Type "Python: Select Interpreter"
     * Look for your Anaconda environment (usually shows as "base")

## Verifying Anaconda Environment

To check if VS Code is using your Anaconda environment:

1. Open an existing Python file (`.py` extension) or create a new file, write `print("Hello, VS Code!")`, and save it as `hello.py`
2. Look at the bottom status bar - you should see your Python version and environment
3. Open a new terminal in VS Code (`Terminal > New Terminal`)
4. You should see `(base)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt

## Useful VS Code Features for Python

#### In-built features

* IntelliSense: Autocomplete and syntax highlighting
* Linting: Code error checking
* Debugging: Built-in debugger
* Git Integration: Version control support

#### Extensions

*   Jupyter Notebooks: Direct support for `.ipynb` files

    > However, we will be using Jupyter Notebook in the Anaconda Navigator in this course
* [`autoDocstring`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring) - quickly generate docstrings for python functions.
* [`Error Lens`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens) - turbo-charges language diagnostic features by making diagnostics stand out more prominently, highlighting the entire line wherever a diagnostic is generated by the language and also prints the message inline.
* [`Even Better TOML`](https://open-vsx.org/extension/tamasfe/even-better-toml) -&#x20;
* `Jupyter` - because data science
* `pylens` - because I'd like to know what dependencies have updated
* `Python Indent` - because I value my sanity
* [`Ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) - nice performant linter + `isort` functionality
* [`View Image for Python Debugging`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=elazarcoh.simply-view-image-for-python-debugging) - if your data science work sometimes strays away from Jupyter notebooks, you'll understand why
