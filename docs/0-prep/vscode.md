# IDE Setup

## What is an IDE?

An **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment) is a code editor with extra features like error checking, autocomplete, and debugging tools. Think of it as a word processor, but for writing code instead of documents.

## Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

**What is VS Code?** VS Code is a **free** code editor made by Microsoft. It's lightweight, fast, and has amazing features for Python development.

**Why use VS Code?**
- ✅ **Free** - Completely free to use
- ✅ **Lightweight** - Doesn't slow down your computer
- ✅ **Extensible** - Thousands of free extensions
- ✅ **Great for Python** - Excellent Python support
- ✅ **Popular** - Used by millions of developers
- ✅ **Cross-platform** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

> **Note:** This guide assumes you have Anaconda or `uv` installed. If not, please refer to the `Getting Started with Anaconda` or `Python for Data Science` guides first.

## Setting Up Python in VS Code

> **Time needed:** About 5 minutes

### Step 1: Install VS Code

If you don't have VS Code yet:

1. Visit [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download for your operating system
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts
4. Launch VS Code

### Step 2: Install the Python Extension

**Extensions add features to VS Code.** The Python extension is essential for Python development.

1. Open VS Code
2. Click the **Extensions icon** in the left sidebar (looks like four squares, or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`)
3. In the search box, type: **"Python"**
4. Find **"Python"** by Microsoft (it should be the first result)
5. Click the **"Install"** button
6. Wait for installation to complete

> **Tip:** VS Code will suggest installing the Python extension automatically when you open a `.py` file!

### Step 3: Configure Your Python Environment

**What is a Python interpreter?** It's the Python program that runs your code. VS Code needs to know which one to use.

**Automatic Detection:**
- If you have Anaconda: VS Code usually detects it automatically
- If you're using `uv`: VS Code will find your `.venv` folder

**Manual Selection (if needed):**

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS)
2. Type: **"Python: Select Interpreter"**
3. Press Enter
4. You'll see a list of Python environments:
   - Anaconda environments show as: `Python 3.10.x ('base': conda)`
   - `uv` environments show as: `Python 3.10.x ('.venv': venv)`
5. Click on the one you want to use

> **Tip:** You can see which interpreter is active in the bottom-right corner of VS Code!

## Verifying Python Environment

To check if VS Code is using your Python environment:

1. Open an existing Python file (`.py` extension) or create a new file, write `print("Hello, VS Code!")`, and save it as `hello.py`
2. Look at the bottom status bar - you should see your Python version and environment
3. Open a new terminal in VS Code (`Terminal > New Terminal`)
4. You should see your environment name at the beginning of your terminal prompt:
   * Anaconda: `(base)` or `(dsai)`
   * uv: `(.venv)` or your virtual environment name

## Useful VS Code Features for Python

#### In-built features

* IntelliSense: Autocomplete and syntax highlighting
* Linting: Code error checking
* Debugging: Built-in debugger
* Git Integration: Version control support

#### Extensions

*   Jupyter Notebooks: Direct support for `.ipynb` files

    > However, we will be using Jupyter Notebook in the Anaconda Navigator in this course
* [`autoDocstring`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring) - quickly generate docstrings for python functions.
* [`Error Lens`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens) - turbo-charges language diagnostic features by making diagnostics stand out more prominently, highlighting the entire line wherever a diagnostic is generated by the language and also prints the message inline.
* [`Even Better TOML`](https://open-vsx.org/extension/tamasfe/even-better-toml) -&#x20;
* `Jupyter` - because data science
* `pylens` - because I'd like to know what dependencies have updated
* `Python Indent` - because I value my sanity
* [`Ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) - nice performant linter + `isort` functionality
* [`View Image for Python Debugging`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=elazarcoh.simply-view-image-for-python-debugging) - if your data science work sometimes strays away from Jupyter notebooks, you'll understand why
