# Quiz: Inferential Statistics

## Questions

1. What is the purpose of inferential statistics?
   _a. To draw conclusions about populations from samples_
   b. To organize and summarize data
   c. To collect data
   d. To create visualizations

**Explanation**: Inferential statistics is crucial because it:
- Allows us to make generalizations about populations using sample data
- Quantifies uncertainty in our estimates
- Helps test hypotheses about population parameters
- Enables decision-making with limited data
This is particularly important when studying large populations where examining every member is impractical.

2. What is a population parameter?
   a. A sample statistic
   _b. A numerical value that describes a population characteristic_
   c. A type of graph
   d. A data collection method

**Explanation**: A population parameter is:
- A fixed value that describes an entire population
- Often unknown in practice
- The target of statistical inference
- Denoted by Greek letters (e.g., μ for mean, σ for standard deviation)
Understanding parameters is crucial because they:
- Define what we're trying to estimate
- Guide our sampling strategies
- Help formulate research questions
- Form the basis for hypothesis testing

3. What does a p-value represent?
   a. The probability the null hypothesis is true
   _b. The probability of obtaining results as extreme as observed, assuming null hypothesis is true_
   c. The probability the alternative hypothesis is true
   d. The sample size needed

**Explanation**: A p-value is:
- A measure of evidence against the null hypothesis
- Based on the assumption that the null hypothesis is true
- Used to make decisions in hypothesis testing
- NOT the probability that the null hypothesis is true
Common misconceptions to avoid:
- Small p-value doesn't prove alternative hypothesis
- P-value isn't the probability of making a mistake
- P-value doesn't measure practical significance

4. What is a confidence interval?
   a. A single point estimate
   _b. A range of values likely to contain the population parameter_
   c. The sample size
   d. The margin of error

**Explanation**: A confidence interval:
- Provides a range of plausible values for a parameter
- Indicates precision of our estimate
- Accounts for sampling variability
- Has an associated confidence level (e.g., 95%)
Key concepts include:
- Wider intervals indicate less precision
- Confidence level affects interval width
- Larger samples generally give narrower intervals
- Interpretation is about the method, not individual intervals

*For more information, see: [Confidence Intervals](../4.1-inferential-stats/confidence-intervals.md)*

5. What is the Central Limit Theorem?
   _a. Sample means follow normal distribution for large samples_
   b. All data is normally distributed
   c. Larger samples are always better
   d. Population means are always known

**Explanation**: The Central Limit Theorem states that:
- Sample means approximate normal distribution as sample size increases
- This holds regardless of population distribution
- Requires sufficiently large sample size (usually n ≥ 30)
- Forms the basis for many statistical procedures
Implications include:
- Enables use of normal-theory methods
- Justifies confidence interval construction
- Supports hypothesis testing procedures
- Explains why normal distribution is so important
