# Quiz: Statistical Modeling

## Questions

1. What is logistic regression used for?
   _a. Predicting binary outcomes_
   b. Predicting continuous outcomes
   c. Testing independence
   d. Comparing means

**Explanation**: Logistic regression:
- Models probability of binary outcomes
- Uses logit link function
- Produces odds ratios
- Handles categorical predictors
Key features:
- Output bounded between 0 and 1
- Non-linear relationship
- Maximum likelihood estimation
- Can be extended to multiple classes

2. What is polynomial regression?
   _a. Modeling nonlinear relationships_
   b. Testing categorical variables
   c. Comparing groups
   d. Measuring correlation

**Explanation**: Polynomial regression:
- Extends linear regression to curved relationships
- Uses polynomial terms (x², x³, etc.)
- Can capture complex patterns
- Risk of overfitting increases with degree
Important considerations:
- Degree selection
- Interpretability decreases with complexity
- Need for more data with higher degrees
- Balance between fit and simplicity

*For more information, see: [Polynomial Regression](../4.4-stat-modelling/polynomial-regression.md)*

3. What is regularization used for?
   _a. Preventing overfitting_
   b. Increasing model complexity
   c. Testing hypotheses
   d. Collecting data

**Explanation**: Regularization:
- Controls model complexity
- Reduces overfitting
- Handles multicollinearity
- Improves generalization
Common methods:
- Ridge (L2) regularization
- Lasso (L1) regularization
- Elastic Net (combination)
- Parameter tuning via cross-validation

*For more information, see: [Regularization](../4.4-stat-modelling/regularization.md)*

4. What is cross-validation?
   _a. Method for assessing model performance_
   b. Type of hypothesis test
   c. Correlation measure
   d. Data collection technique

**Explanation**: Cross-validation:
- Evaluates model generalization
- Uses multiple train-test splits
- Provides robust performance estimates
- Helps detect overfitting
Common types:
- k-fold cross-validation
- Leave-one-out cross-validation
- Stratified cross-validation
- Time series cross-validation

*For more information, see: [Model Selection](../4.4-stat-modelling/model-selection.md)*

5. What is the purpose of model selection?
   _a. Choosing best model among alternatives_
   b. Collecting data
   c. Testing hypotheses
   d. Calculating probabilities

**Explanation**: Model selection:
- Identifies optimal model from candidates
- Balances complexity and fit
- Uses objective criteria
- Considers multiple factors
Key criteria:
- AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)
- BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)
- Cross-validation error
- Domain knowledge and interpretability

*For more information, see: [Model Selection](../4.4-stat-modelling/model-selection.md) and [Model Interpretation](../4.4-stat-modelling/model-interpretation.md)*
