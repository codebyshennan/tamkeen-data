# Quiz: Relationships in Data

## Questions

1. What does correlation measure?
   _a. Strength and direction of linear relationship_
   b. Causation between variables
   c. Difference between means
   d. Sample size needed

**Explanation**: Correlation:
- Measures strength and direction of linear relationships
- Ranges from -1 to +1
- Does not imply causation
- Is symmetric (correlation of X and Y equals Y and X)
Key points:
- -1 indicates perfect negative correlation
- +1 indicates perfect positive correlation
- 0 indicates no linear relationship
- Only detects linear relationships

2. What is the range of correlation coefficient?
   _a. -1 to +1_
   b. 0 to 1
   c. -∞ to +∞
   d. 0 to 100

**Explanation**: The correlation coefficient range:
- -1: Perfect negative correlation
- +1: Perfect positive correlation
- 0: No linear correlation
Important properties:
- Scale-invariant
- Dimensionless
- Unaffected by linear transformations
- Sensitive to outliers

3. What is simple linear regression used for?
   _a. Predicting one variable using another_
   b. Comparing means
   c. Testing independence
   d. Calculating probabilities

**Explanation**: Simple linear regression:
- Models relationship between two variables
- Predicts dependent variable from independent variable
- Finds best-fitting straight line
- Quantifies relationship strength
Key components:
- Slope (β₁): Change in Y per unit change in X
- Intercept (β₀): Y value when X = 0
- Error term (ε): Random variation
- Assumptions about residuals

4. What is multiple R-squared?
   _a. Proportion of variance explained by model_
   b. Correlation coefficient
   c. Sample size
   d. Test statistic

**Explanation**: Multiple R-squared:
- Measures model's explanatory power
- Ranges from 0 to 1
- Increases with more predictors
- Can be adjusted for model complexity
Interpretation:
- 1.0: Perfect prediction
- 0.0: No explanatory power
- Often expressed as percentage
- Should be considered with other metrics

5. What is multicollinearity?
   _a. High correlation between predictor variables_
   b. Correlation between response variables
   c. Sample size requirement
   d. Type of hypothesis test

**Explanation**: Multicollinearity occurs when:
- Predictor variables are highly correlated
- Makes coefficient estimates unstable
- Increases standard errors
- Makes interpretation difficult
Solutions include:
- Variable selection
- Principal component analysis
- Ridge regression
- Removing redundant predictors
