   Options:
   a. Sample means follow normal distribution for large samples
   b. All data is normally distributed
   c. Larger samples are always better
   d. Population means are always known

   Answer: a. Sample means follow normal distribution for large samples
   Explanation: CLT states that sampling distributions of means approach normal distribution as sample size increases.

## Part 2: Hypothesis Testing

6. Question: What is the null hypothesis?
   Options:
   a. Statement of no effect or relationship
   b. Statement of desired outcome
   c. Statement of sample size
   d. Statement of confidence level

   Answer: a. Statement of no effect or relationship
   Explanation: The null hypothesis represents the status quo or no effect position.

7. Question: What is Type I error?
   Options:
   a. Rejecting true null hypothesis
   b. Failing to reject false null hypothesis
   c. Selecting wrong sample size
   d. Using wrong test statistic

   Answer: a. Rejecting true null hypothesis
   Explanation: Type I error occurs when we reject a null hypothesis that is actually true.

8. Question: What is statistical power?
   Options:
   a. Sample size
   b. Probability of correctly rejecting false null hypothesis
   c. Significance level
   d. Effect size

   Answer: b. Probability of correctly rejecting false null hypothesis
   Explanation: Statistical power is the probability of detecting a true effect when it exists.

9. Question: What is the purpose of A/B testing?
   Options:
   a. To compare two versions of something
   b. To collect data
   c. To visualize results
   d. To calculate p-values

   Answer: a. To compare two versions of something
   Explanation: A/B testing compares two variants to determine which performs better.

10. Question: Which test is used for comparing means of two independent groups?
    Options:
    a. Chi-square test
    b. Independent t-test
    c. ANOVA
    d. Correlation test

    Answer: b. Independent t-test

    Options:
    a. -1 to +1
    b. 0 to 1
    c. -∞ to +∞

    Options:
    a. Predicting one variable using another
    b. Comparing means
    c. Testing independence
    d. Calculating probabilities

    Options:
    a. Proportion of variance explained by model
    b. Correlation coefficient
    c. Sample size
    d. Test statistic

    Answer: a. Proportion of variance explained by model
    Explanation: R-squared indicates how much variation in the response is explained by the predictors.

15. Question: What is multicollinearity?
    Options:
    a. High correlation between predictor variables

    Answer: a. High correlation between predictor variables
