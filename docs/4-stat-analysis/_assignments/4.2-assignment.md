# Quiz: Hypothesis Testing

## Questions

1. What is the null hypothesis?
   _a. Statement of no effect or relationship_
   b. Statement of desired outcome
   c. Statement of sample size
   d. Statement of confidence level

**Explanation**: The null hypothesis (H₀) is:
- A default position of "no effect" or "no difference"
- The hypothesis we try to reject with evidence
- Usually states equality or no change
- The basis for statistical testing
Important concepts:
- Must be specific and testable
- Cannot be proven, only rejected
- Forms basis for p-value calculation
- Helps control Type I error rate

2. What is Type I error?
   _a. Rejecting true null hypothesis_
   b. Failing to reject false null hypothesis
   c. Selecting wrong sample size
   d. Using wrong test statistic

**Explanation**: Type I error (false positive):
- Occurs when we reject a true null hypothesis
- Probability is equal to significance level (α)
- Usually set at 0.05 or 0.01
- More serious than Type II error in many contexts
Key considerations:
- Trade-off with Type II error
- Controlled by significance level
- Important in multiple testing
- Critical in medical/legal decisions

3. What is statistical power?
   a. Sample size
   _b. Probability of correctly rejecting false null hypothesis_
   c. Significance level
   d. Effect size

**Explanation**: Statistical power:
- Ability to detect a true effect when it exists
- Equals 1 - β (β is Type II error rate)
- Increases with sample size
- Depends on effect size
Factors affecting power:
- Sample size
- Effect size
- Significance level
- Variability in data
Common target is 0.80 (80% power)

4. What is the purpose of A/B testing?
   _a. To compare two versions of something_
   b. To collect data
   c. To visualize results
   d. To calculate p-values

**Explanation**: A/B testing is used to:
- Compare two versions of a treatment/intervention
- Make data-driven decisions
- Optimize products/services
- Test specific hypotheses
Key components include:
- Control group (A)
- Treatment group (B)
- Random assignment
- Clear success metrics
- Statistical analysis

*For more information, see: [AB Testing](../4.2-hypotheses-testing/ab-testing.md)*

5. Which test is used for comparing means of two independent groups?
   a. Chi-square test
   _b. Independent t-test_
   c. ANOVA
   d. Correlation test

**Explanation**: Independent t-test is used when:
- Comparing means of two independent groups
- Data is continuous
- Groups are normally distributed
- Variances are approximately equal
Assumptions include:
- Independence of observations
- Normal distribution
- Homogeneity of variance
- Random sampling
