# Statistical Modeling with Python

In this module, we'll explore advanced statistical modeling techniques using Python, focusing on logistic regression for classification problems and polynomial regression for non-linear relationships. We'll use real-world examples to demonstrate how these models can be applied to solve practical problems.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand logistic regression for binary classification
- Master polynomial regression for non-linear relationships
- Learn model selection and validation techniques
- Apply regularization methods
- Interpret and communicate model results

## Topics Covered
1. [Logistic Regression Fundamentals](./logistic-regression.md)
2. [Polynomial Regression](./polynomial-regression.md)
3. [Model Selection](./model-selection.md)
4. [Regularization Techniques](./regularization.md)
5. [Model Interpretation](./model-interpretation.md)

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of basic statistics
- Knowledge of linear regression
- Python programming skills
- Familiarity with NumPy and Pandas
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts

## Why This Matters
Advanced statistical modeling is crucial for:
- Predicting binary outcomes
- Handling non-linear relationships
- Making better predictions
- Understanding complex patterns
- Building robust models

Whether you're working in business analytics, scientific research, or data science, understanding these advanced modeling techniques will help you tackle more complex problems and make better data-driven decisions.
