# Testing Hypotheses: From Questions to Answers

## Introduction: The Scientific Method in Action

Welcome to the world of hypothesis testing! This guide is designed to help you understand how to turn questions into answers through systematic experimentation. Whether you're optimizing a website, developing a new drug, or researching customer behavior, hypothesis testing provides the framework for making data-driven decisions with confidence.

## Real-world Applications

### E-commerce Example

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# A/B test on website conversion rates
def ab_test_demo():
    # Control group (current design)
    control_conversions = np.random.binomial(n=1000, p=0.10)
    
    # Treatment group (new design)
    treatment_conversions = np.random.binomial(n=1000, p=0.12)
    
    # Perform chi-square test
    contingency = np.array([
        [sum(control_conversions), 1000 - sum(control_conversions)],
        [sum(treatment_conversions), 1000 - sum(treatment_conversions)]
    ])
    
    chi2, p_value = stats.chi2_contingency(contingency)[:2]
    
    print("E-commerce A/B Test Results")
    print(f"Control Conversion: {sum(control_conversions)/1000:.1%}")
    print(f"Treatment Conversion: {sum(treatment_conversions)/1000:.1%}")
    print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")
    print(f"Significant? {'Yes' if p_value < 0.05 else 'No'}")

# Run demonstration
ab_test_demo()
```

### Medical Research Example

```python
def clinical_trial_demo():
    # Control group (standard treatment)
    control = np.random.normal(loc=10, scale=2, size=100)
    
    # Treatment group (new drug)
    treatment = np.random.normal(loc=9, scale=2, size=100)
    
    # Perform t-test
    t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(control, treatment)
    
    print("\nClinical Trial Analysis")
    print(f"Control Mean: {np.mean(control):.1f} days")
    print(f"Treatment Mean: {np.mean(treatment):.1f} days")
    print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")
    print(f"Improvement: {'Yes' if p_value < 0.05 else 'No'}")

# Run demonstration
clinical_trial_demo()
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Planning Phase

- Define clear objectives
- Calculate required sample size
- Control for confounders
- Document methodology

### 2. Execution Phase

- Randomize properly
- Monitor data quality
- Track all variables
- Maintain consistency

### 3. Analysis Phase

- Check assumptions
- Use appropriate tests
- Calculate effect sizes
- Consider practical significance

### 4. Reporting Phase

- Be transparent
- Include visualizations
- Acknowledge limitations
- Make actionable recommendations

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. P-hacking (multiple testing without correction)
2. Insufficient sample size
3. Ignoring assumptions
4. Confounding variables
5. Stopping tests too early

## Learning Path

1. Start with experimental design fundamentals
2. Master hypothesis formulation
3. Practice A/B testing methodology
4. Learn statistical test selection
5. Apply to real-world problems

## Recommended Visualizations

To enhance understanding, we recommend adding the following visualizations:

1. **Scientific Method Flowchart**
   - A step-by-step diagram showing the hypothesis testing process
   - Should include: Question → Hypothesis → Experiment → Analysis → Conclusion

2. **Statistical Test Decision Tree**
   - Interactive flowchart to help choose the right statistical test
   - Should include: Data type → Number of groups → Distribution → Test selection

3. **A/B Testing Timeline**
   - Visual timeline showing the stages of an A/B test
   - Should include: Planning → Setup → Running → Analysis → Implementation

4. **Effect Size Visualization**
   - Side-by-side comparison of different effect sizes
   - Should show: Small vs Medium vs Large effects with real-world examples

5. **Confidence Interval Diagram**
   - Visual explanation of confidence intervals
   - Should demonstrate: Point estimate, margin of error, and interpretation

Remember: Good hypothesis testing is about asking the right questions and using the right tools to find reliable answers!
