## 🌟 Real-world Applications

### E-commerce Example
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# A/B test on website conversion rates
def ab_test_demo():
    # Control group (current design)
    control_conversions = np.random.binomial(n=1000, p=0.10)
    
    # Treatment group (new design)
    treatment_conversions = np.random.binomial(n=1000, p=0.12)
    
    # Perform chi-square test
    contingency = np.array([
        [sum(control_conversions), 1000 - sum(control_conversions)],
        [sum(treatment_conversions), 1000 - sum(treatment_conversions)]
    ])
    
    chi2, p_value = stats.chi2_contingency(contingency)[:2]
    
    print("🛍️ E-commerce A/B Test Results")
    print(f"Control Conversion: {sum(control_conversions)/1000:.1%}")
    print(f"Treatment Conversion: {sum(treatment_conversions)/1000:.1%}")
    print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")
    print(f"Significant? {'✅' if p_value < 0.05 else '❌'}")

# Run demonstration
ab_test_demo()
```

### Medical Research Example
```python
def clinical_trial_demo():
    # Control group (standard treatment)
    control = np.random.normal(loc=10, scale=2, size=100)
    
    # Treatment group (new drug)
    treatment = np.random.normal(loc=9, scale=2, size=100)
    
    # Perform t-test
    t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(control, treatment)
    
    print("\n🏥 Clinical Trial Analysis")
    print(f"Control Mean: {np.mean(control):.1f} days")
    print(f"Treatment Mean: {np.mean(treatment):.1f} days")
    print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")
    print(f"Improvement: {'✅' if p_value < 0.05 else '❌'}")

# Run demonstration
clinical_trial_demo()
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Planning Phase
- Define clear objectives
- Calculate required sample size
- Control for confounders
- Document methodology

### 2. Execution Phase
- Randomize properly
- Monitor data quality
- Track all variables
- Maintain consistency

### 3. Analysis Phase
- Check assumptions
- Use appropriate tests
- Calculate effect sizes
- Consider practical significance

### 4. Reporting Phase
- Be transparent
- Include visualizations
- Acknowledge limitations
- Make actionable recommendations

## 🚫 Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. P-hacking (multiple testing without correction)
2. Insufficient sample size
3. Ignoring assumptions
4. Confounding variables
5. Stopping tests too early
