# Population vs Sample: The Foundation of Statistical Inference

## Before You Begin

- Basic understanding of descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Familiarity with basic probability concepts
- Basic Python programming knowledge (for examples)

## Key Terms

- **Population**: The complete set of all items or individuals we want to study
- **Sample**: A subset of the population that we actually measure
- **Sampling**: The process of selecting a sample from a population
- **Parameter**: A numerical characteristic of a population
- **Statistic**: A numerical characteristic of a sample

*Figure 1: Visual representation of key terms in sampling. The diagram shows how parameters describe populations and statistics describe samples.*

## Introduction: The Detective Analogy

Imagine you're a detective trying to understand a city's crime patterns. You can't investigate every single crime (population), but you can study a carefully selected set of cases (sample) to make informed conclusions about the whole city. This is the essence of sampling in statistics!

## What is a Population?

### Definition

A population is the **complete set** of all items, individuals, or measurements that we're interested in studying. It's the "big picture" we want to understand.

### Real-world Examples

1. **Business Context**:
   - All customers who have ever shopped at an e-commerce store
   - Every transaction processed by a payment system
   - All products in a company's inventory

2. **Research Context**:
   - All students in a university
   - Every patient with a specific medical condition
   - All trees in a forest

### Visual Representation

![Population and Sample Relationship](assets/population_sample_diagram.png)
*Figure 2: The relationship between population and sample. The larger circle represents the entire population, while the smaller circle inside represents our sample.*

## What is a Sample?

### Definition

A sample is a carefully selected **subset** of the population that we actually measure and analyze. Think of it as our "window" into the larger population.

### Real-world Examples

1. **Business Context**:
   - 1,000 randomly selected customers for a satisfaction survey
   - 10,000 transactions from last month for fraud analysis
   - 100 products for quality testing

2. **Research Context**:
   - 200 students surveyed about campus facilities
   - 50 patients participating in a clinical trial
   - 500 trees measured in a forest study

## Why Do We Need Samples?

### Practical Reasons

1. **Cost**: Studying entire populations is often expensive
2. **Time**: Complete enumeration takes too long
3. **Feasibility**: Some populations are infinite or constantly changing
4. **Destructive Testing**: Some measurements destroy the item being measured

### Example: Quality Control in Manufacturing

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simulate a production batch of 10,000 items
population = np.random.normal(loc=100, scale=5, size=10000)  # Target: 100 units

# Take a sample of 100 items
sample = np.random.choice(population, size=100, replace=False)

# Visualize population and sample
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.subplot(121)
plt.hist(population, bins=30, alpha=0.7, color='blue')
plt.axvline(np.mean(population), color='red', linestyle='--', label='Population Mean')
plt.title('Population Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Measurement')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.legend()

plt.subplot(122)
plt.hist(sample, bins=15, alpha=0.7, color='green')
plt.axvline(np.mean(sample), color='red', linestyle='--', label='Sample Mean')
plt.title('Sample Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Measurement')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('assets/population_sample_dist.png')
plt.close()

# Print statistics
print("\nQuality Control Analysis")
print(f"Population mean: {np.mean(population):.2f}")
print(f"Sample mean: {np.mean(sample):.2f}")
print(f"Difference: {abs(np.mean(population) - np.mean(sample)):.2f}")
```

## Sampling Methods: Choosing Your Strategy

### 1. Simple Random Sampling (SRS)

The statistical equivalent of drawing names from a hat - every member has an equal chance.

```python
def simple_random_sample(population, sample_size):
    """Generate a simple random sample"""
    return np.random.choice(population, size=sample_size, replace=False)

# Example usage with visualization
population = np.arange(1000)  # IDs 0-999
sample = simple_random_sample(population, 100)

# Visualize the sampling process
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(population, [0]*len(population), alpha=0.3, label='Population')
plt.scatter(sample, [0.1]*len(sample), color='red', label='Selected Sample')
plt.title('Simple Random Sampling')
plt.xlabel('Population ID')
plt.yticks([])
plt.legend()
plt.savefig('assets/simple_random_sampling.png')
plt.close()

print(f"Random sample IDs: {sample[:5]}...")  # Show first 5 IDs
```

![Simple Random Sampling](assets/simple_random_sampling.png)
*Figure 4: Visualization of simple random sampling. Each point represents a member of the population, with red points indicating selected sample members.*

### 2. Stratified Sampling

Like organizing a party where you ensure representation from different departments.

```python
def stratified_sample(population, strata_sizes, sample_sizes):
    """Generate a stratified sample"""
    samples = []
    start_idx = 0
    
    # Visualize the strata
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
    colors = ['blue', 'green', 'red']
    
    for i, (stratum_size, sample_size) in enumerate(zip(strata_sizes, sample_sizes)):
        stratum = population[start_idx:start_idx + stratum_size]
        sample = np.random.choice(stratum, size=sample_size, replace=False)
        samples.extend(sample)
        
        # Plot stratum
        plt.scatter(stratum, [i]*len(stratum), alpha=0.3, color=colors[i], 
                   label=f'Stratum {i+1}')
        plt.scatter(sample, [i+0.1]*len(sample), color=colors[i], 
                   label=f'Sample {i+1}' if i==0 else "")
        
        start_idx += stratum_size
    
    plt.title('Stratified Sampling')
    plt.xlabel('Population ID')
    plt.yticks(range(len(strata_sizes)), [f'Stratum {i+1}' for i in range(len(strata_sizes))])
    plt.legend()
    plt.savefig('assets/stratified_sampling.png')
    plt.close()
    
    return np.array(samples)

# Example: Sampling by age groups
population = np.arange(3000)  # 3000 people
strata_sizes = [1000, 1000, 1000]  # Equal size strata
sample_sizes = [50, 50, 50]  # Equal size samples
sample = stratified_sample(population, strata_sizes, sample_sizes)
```

![Stratified Sampling](assets/stratified_sampling.png)
*Figure 5: Visualization of stratified sampling. The population is divided into three strata (blue, green, red), and samples are taken from each stratum.*

### 3. Systematic Sampling

Like picking every 10th person who walks into a store.

```python
def systematic_sample(population, interval):
    """Generate a systematic sample"""
    start = np.random.randint(0, interval)
    sample = population[start::interval]
    
    # Visualize the sampling process
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.scatter(population, [0]*len(population), alpha=0.3, label='Population')
    plt.scatter(sample, [0.1]*len(sample), color='red', label='Selected Sample')
    plt.title(f'Systematic Sampling (Interval: {interval})')
    plt.xlabel('Population ID')
    plt.yticks([])
    plt.legend()
    plt.savefig('assets/systematic_sampling.png')
    plt.close()
    
    return sample

# Example: Select every 10th customer
population = np.arange(1000)
sample = systematic_sample(population, 10)
```

![Systematic Sampling](assets/systematic_sampling.png)
*Figure 6: Visualization of systematic sampling. The red points show how every 10th member is selected from the population.*

### 4. Cluster Sampling

Like studying a few neighborhoods to understand a city.

```python
def cluster_sample(population, n_clusters, cluster_size):
    """Generate a cluster sample"""
    clusters = np.random.choice(len(population) // cluster_size, size=n_clusters, replace=False)
    samples = []
    
    # Visualize the clusters
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
    plt.scatter(population, [0]*len(population), alpha=0.3, label='Population')
    
    for i, cluster in enumerate(clusters):
        start = cluster * cluster_size
        end = start + cluster_size
        cluster_members = population[start:end]
        samples.extend(cluster_members)
        
        # Plot cluster
        plt.scatter(cluster_members, [0.1]*len(cluster_members), 
                   color=f'C{i}', label=f'Cluster {i+1}' if i==0 else "")
    
    plt.title(f'Cluster Sampling ({n_clusters} clusters of size {cluster_size})')
    plt.xlabel('Population ID')
    plt.yticks([])
    plt.legend()
    plt.savefig('assets/cluster_sampling.png')
    plt.close()
    
    return np.array(samples)

# Example: Sample 5 clusters of 20 people each
population = np.arange(1000)
sample = cluster_sample(population, 5, 20)
```

## Common Sampling Errors and How to Avoid Them

### 1. Selection Bias

When your sample isn't truly representative.

#### Example

‚ùå Surveying only mall shoppers about online shopping habits
‚úÖ Using a mix of in-store and online customer lists

### 2. Sampling Error

Natural variation between sample and population.

```python
def calculate_sampling_error(population_std, sample_size):
    """Calculate standard error of the mean"""
    return population_std / np.sqrt(sample_size)

# Example with visualization
population_std = 15
sample_sizes = [10, 100, 1000]
ses = []

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
for n in sample_sizes:
    se = calculate_sampling_error(population_std, n)
    ses.append(se)
    print(f"Sample size {n}: Standard Error = {se:.2f}")

plt.plot(sample_sizes, ses, 'bo-')
plt.xlabel('Sample Size')
plt.ylabel('Standard Error')
plt.title('Effect of Sample Size on Standard Error')
plt.grid(True)
plt.savefig('assets/sampling_error_effect.png')
plt.close()
```

![Sampling Error Effect](assets/sampling_error_effect.png)
*Figure 9: Effect of sample size on standard error. As sample size increases, the standard error decreases, showing improved precision.*

### 3. Coverage Error

When your sampling frame misses parts of the population.

#### Example

‚ùå Email survey missing customers without email
‚úÖ Using multiple contact methods (phone, mail, in-person)

## Sample Size Determination

### The Sample Size Formula

For estimating a proportion with specified margin of error:

```python
def calculate_sample_size(confidence_level=0.95, margin_of_error=0.05, p=0.5):
    """Calculate required sample size for proportion estimation"""
    from scipy.stats import norm
    
    z_score = norm.ppf(1 - (1 - confidence_level) / 2)
    n = (z_score**2 * p * (1-p)) / margin_of_error**2
    
    # Visualize the relationship
    margins = np.linspace(0.01, 0.1, 100)
    sizes = [(z_score**2 * p * (1-p)) / m**2 for m in margins]
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(margins, sizes)
    plt.xlabel('Margin of Error')
    plt.ylabel('Required Sample Size')
    plt.title('Sample Size vs Margin of Error')
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.savefig('assets/sample_size_relationship.png')
    plt.close()
    
    return int(n)

# Example usage
n = calculate_sample_size()
print(f"\nRequired sample size: {n}")
```

![Sample Size Relationship](assets/sample_size_relationship.png)
*Figure 10: Relationship between margin of error and required sample size. As the desired margin of error decreases, the required sample size increases.*
