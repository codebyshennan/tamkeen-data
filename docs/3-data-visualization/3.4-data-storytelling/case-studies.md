# Data Storytelling Case Studies: Learning from Real-World Examples

## Introduction: Why Case Studies Matter

Think of case studies like watching game film in sports - they show you what works, what doesn't, and how to improve. These real-world examples will help you understand how to apply data storytelling principles in practice.

## Case Study 1: Sales Performance Dashboard - Walmart's Store Analytics

### The Challenge

Walmart needed to communicate monthly sales performance to store managers across their 4,700+ US stores. The original dashboard was cluttered and confusing, making it difficult for managers to identify key performance issues and opportunities.

### The Bad Version

![Bad Dashboard Example](assets/bad_dashboard.png)

**Problems Explained:**

- **Too many metrics at once**: Managers were overwhelmed with 50+ KPIs, making it impossible to focus on what mattered most
- **Inconsistent color scheme**: Random colors made it difficult to quickly identify positive vs negative trends
- **No clear hierarchy**: All metrics appeared equally important, with no visual cues for prioritization
- **Missing context**: Numbers were presented without historical comparisons or industry benchmarks
- **Confusing layout**: Related metrics were scattered across different sections, breaking natural data relationships

#### Detailed Breakdown of Bad Practices

1. **Cluttered Metrics**
   ![Too Many Metrics](assets/bad_dashboard_metrics.png)
