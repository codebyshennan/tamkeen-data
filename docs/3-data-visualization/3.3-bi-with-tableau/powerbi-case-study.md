## Advanced DAX Patterns

### 1. Time Intelligence Functions

```dax
// Year-to-Date Sales
YTD Sales = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM([Sales]),
    DATESYTD('Date'[Date])
)

// Previous Year Comparison
PY Sales = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM([Sales]),
    SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date])
)

// Moving Average
MA Sales = 
AVERAGEX(
    DATESINPERIOD(
        'Date'[Date],
        LASTDATE('Date'[Date]),
        -3,
        MONTH
    ),
    [Sales]
)
```

### 2. Advanced Filter Context

```dax
// Top N Products by Category
Top N Products = 
VAR N = 5
RETURN
CALCULATE(
    SUM([Sales]),
    TOPN(
        N,
        VALUES(Products[Product Name]),
        [Sales],
        DESC
    )
)

// Dynamic Segmentation
Customer Segment = 
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    [Sales] > 10000, "High Value",
    [Sales] > 5000, "Medium Value",
    "Low Value"
)
