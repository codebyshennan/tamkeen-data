## Getting Started

### 1. Opening Tableau and Connecting to Data

1. Launch Tableau Desktop
2. On the start page, under "Connect", select "Sample - Superstore"
   - If not visible, click "Microsoft Excel" and navigate to your Tableau Repository
   - Path: `Documents/My Tableau Repository/Datasources/`

### 2. Understanding the Tableau Workspace

The Tableau interface consists of several key areas:

1. **Data Source Tab**
   - Shows connected tables (Orders, People, Returns)
   - Focus on the Orders table for most analyses

2. **Worksheet Area**
   - **Data Pane**: Left side panel
     - Dimensions (blue): Categorical fields (e.g., Category, State)
     - Measures (green): Numerical fields (e.g., Sales, Profit)
   - **Shelves**: Areas for building visualizations
     - Columns shelf
     - Rows shelf
     - Filters shelf
     - Marks card (for colors, labels, etc.)
   - **Canvas**: Main area where charts appear
   - **Show Me**: Panel for chart suggestions

## Project Overview

In this comprehensive case study, we'll analyze retail data to drive business decisions. By the end of this tutorial, you will create:

- A dynamic sales performance dashboard
- A geographical distribution analysis
- A product profitability analysis
- Interactive filters and drill-downs

[Screenshot: Final Dashboard Preview]
*Caption: The complete dashboard we'll build, showing sales trends, geographical distribution, and product performance.*

## Dataset Introduction

We'll utilize the "Sample - Superstore" dataset included with Tableau. This dataset is ideal for learning because:

- It contains clean, pre-formatted data
- It includes realistic business scenarios
- It's readily available in Tableau
- It covers multiple analysis dimensions
