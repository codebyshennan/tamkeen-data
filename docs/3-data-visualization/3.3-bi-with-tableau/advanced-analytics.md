# Taking Your Tableau Skills to the Next Level 🚀

## Introduction: Beyond the Basics

Now that you're comfortable with basic charts and dashboards, let's explore some powerful features that will make your visualizations even better! Think of this as upgrading from a basic calculator to a scientific calculator - more buttons, but so much more you can do!

## 1. Table Calculations: Making Your Numbers Smarter 🧮

### What Are Table Calculations?

Think of them as Excel formulas that work across your entire visualization. They help you:

- 📊 Compare values over time
- 📈 Calculate growth rates
- 🏆 Rank and analyze performance

### Common Table Calculations (With Real Examples!)

#### Running Total (Like a Growing Bank Balance)

```sql
-- Shows how sales add up over time
Running Total = RUNNING_SUM(SUM([Sales]))

Example Use:
1. Create a line chart of sales
2. Add running total:
   - Right-click the Sales pill
   - Quick Table Calculation
   - Running Total
```

#### Growth Rate (Like Calculating Interest)

```sql
-- Shows how much something grew
Growth = 
([Sales] - LOOKUP([Sales], -1)) / 
LOOKUP([Sales], -1)

Example Use:
1. Create a bar chart of monthly sales
2. Add growth rate:
   - Right-click the Sales pill
   - Quick Table Calculation
   - Percent Difference
```

#### Moving Average (Smoothing Out the Bumps)

```sql
-- Averages last 3 periods to smooth trends
Moving Avg = 
WINDOW_AVG(SUM([Sales]), -2, 0)

Example Use:
1. Create a line chart
2. Add moving average:
   - Analytics pane
   - Drag 'Moving Average'
   - Choose 3 periods
```

## 2. Level of Detail (LOD) Expressions: The Secret Sauce 🔍

### What Are LOD Expressions?

Think of them as a way to look at your data from different angles at the same time. Like having multiple magnifying glasses!

### Types of LOD (With Examples)

#### FIXED: Look at Specific Things

```sql
-- Find average order value per customer
{FIXED [Customer Name] : 
    AVG([Sales])}

Real-World Use:
1. Find big spenders
2. Compare to overall average
3. Identify VIP customers
```

#### INCLUDE: Add Extra Detail

```sql
-- Sales by product within each region
{INCLUDE [Product]: 
    SUM([Sales])}

When to Use:
1. Comparing product performance
2. Finding regional favorites
3. Spotting trends
```

#### EXCLUDE: Remove Some Detail

```sql
-- Overall average excluding regions
{EXCLUDE [Region]: 
    AVG([Sales])}

Perfect For:
1. Company-wide metrics
2. Removing seasonal effects
3. Overall trends
```

## 3. Advanced Charts: Making Your Data Beautiful 🎨

### Combo Charts (Two Charts in One!)

```yaml
Steps to Create:
1. Start with a bar chart
2. Drag second measure to right axis
3. Right-click → Dual Axis
4. Change mark types for each measure

Example:
- Bars for Sales
- Line for Profit
```

### Custom Charts (Be Creative!)

```yaml
Try These Cool Ideas:
1. Dumbbell Charts:
   - Compare two points in time
   - Show before/after
   - Highlight changes

2. Bullet Charts:
   - Show targets vs actual
   - Add color bands
   - Highlight performance

3. Waterfall Charts:
   - Show how values build up
   - Track additions/subtractions
   - Visualize flow
```

## 4. Making It Interactive: Bringing Your Dashboard to Life 🎮

### Parameters (Let Users Choose!)

```yaml
Create a Parameter:
1. Right-click in Data pane
2. Create Parameter
3. Choose type (number, date, list)
4. Add to your visualization

Example Uses:
- Top N selector
- Date range picker
- Threshold setter
```

### Actions (Make Things Happen!)

```yaml
Types of Actions:
1. Filter Actions:
   - Click map → filter table
   - Select bar → highlight related
   
2. Highlight Actions:
   - Hover → highlight connected
   - Click → emphasize related
   
3. URL Actions:
   - Click → open webpage
   - Link to details
   - Connect to docs
```

## 5. Best Practices for Advanced Analytics 💡

### Performance Tips

```yaml
Speed Up Your Dashboard:
1. Use Extracts Instead of Live:
   - Faster performance
   - Work offline
   - Schedule updates

2. Optimize Calculations:
   - Use built-in functions
   - Minimize complexity
   - Pre-aggregate when possible

3. Filter Efficiently:
   - Use context filters
   - Apply filters early
   - Limit date ranges
```

### Design for Understanding

```yaml
Make It Clear:
1. Add Context:
   - Reference lines
   - Annotations
   - Clear titles

2. Guide Users:
   - Instructions
   - Tool tips
   - Legend explanations

3. Keep It Clean:
   - Remove clutter
   - Use consistent colors
   - Clear hierarchy
```
