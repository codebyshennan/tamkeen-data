## Advanced Features

### 1. Calculated Fields

1. Basic Calculations:

```sql
-- Profit Ratio
Profit Ratio = Profit / Sales

-- Sales Growth
Sales Growth = 
(SELECT SUM(Sales) 
 WHERE Order Date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH))
/
(SELECT SUM(Sales) 
 WHERE Order Date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 2 MONTH))
- 1

-- Customer Segment
Customer Segment = 
CASE
  WHEN SUM(Sales) > 10000 THEN "High Value"
  WHEN SUM(Sales) > 5000 THEN "Medium Value"
  ELSE "Low Value"
END
```

2. Advanced Functions:

```sql
-- Moving Average (3-month)
Moving Average = 
AVG(Sales) OVER (
  ORDER BY Order Date 
  ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
)

-- Running Total
Running Total = 
SUM(Sales) OVER (
  ORDER BY Order Date 
  ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
)

-- Percent of Total
Percent of Total = 
SUM(Sales) / 
(SELECT SUM(Sales) FROM Orders)
```
