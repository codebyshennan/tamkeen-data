# Quiz: Introduction to Data Visualization

## Questions

1. What is the primary purpose of data visualization?
   a. To make data look pretty
   b. To store data efficiently
   _c. To communicate insights effectively_
   d. To clean data

**Explanation**: Data visualization's main purpose is to communicate insights effectively by:
- Converting complex data into easily understandable visual formats
- Highlighting patterns and trends that might be missed in raw data
- Making data more accessible to diverse audiences
- Supporting data-driven decision making
- Facilitating quick understanding of key information

2. Which Matplotlib function creates a new figure?
   _a. plt.figure()_
   b. plt.plot()
   c. plt.show()
   d. plt.draw()

**Explanation**: `plt.figure()` is the fundamental function for creating a new figure in Matplotlib because it:
- Initializes a new figure object
- Sets up the drawing canvas
- Allows customization of figure properties (size, DPI, etc.)
- Returns a figure object for further manipulation
Other functions serve different purposes:
- plt.plot(): Adds a plot to existing figure
- plt.show(): Displays the figure
- plt.draw(): Updates the figure

3. What is the difference between plt.show() and plt.draw()?
   a. They are identical
   b. plt.draw() is faster
   _c. plt.show() blocks execution while plt.draw() doesn't_
   d. plt.show() is deprecated

**Explanation**: The key differences between plt.show() and plt.draw() are:
- plt.show():
  * Blocks code execution until figure window is closed
  * Suitable for static displays
  * Creates new window if needed
- plt.draw():
  * Updates figure without blocking
  * Better for interactive/animated plots
  * Updates existing window
This distinction is crucial for interactive visualizations and animations.

4. Which principle suggests using minimal design elements?
   a. Redundancy
   _b. Data-ink ratio_
   c. Color theory
   d. Animation

**Explanation**: The data-ink ratio principle, introduced by Edward Tufte, suggests:
- Maximizing the ratio of data representation to total ink used
- Removing non-essential visual elements
- Focusing on the data itself
- Avoiding chart junk and decorative elements
This principle helps create clear, efficient visualizations that effectively communicate data.

5. What is a subplot?
   _a. Multiple plots in a single figure_
   b. A type of bar chart
   c. A color scheme
   d. A data filtering method

**Explanation**: Subplots are multiple plots arranged in a single figure that:
- Allow comparison of different aspects of data
- Create dashboard-like layouts
- Efficiently use space
- Share axes when appropriate
- Enable complex data storytelling
They're essential for creating comprehensive visual analyses and comparisons.
