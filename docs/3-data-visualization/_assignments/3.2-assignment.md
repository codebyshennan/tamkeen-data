# Quiz: Advanced Data Visualization

## Questions

1. Which library is built on top of Matplotlib?
   _a. Seaborn_
   b. Bokeh
   c. D3.js
   d. ggplot2

**Explanation**: Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and enhances it by:
- Providing high-level statistical visualization functions
- Offering better default aesthetics and color palettes
- Integrating well with pandas DataFrames
- Simplifying complex statistical visualizations
- Adding specialized plots for statistical analysis
This integration means you can still use Matplotlib commands to customize Seaborn plots.

2. What is the main advantage of Plotly?
   a. Simpler syntax
   b. Faster rendering
   _c. Interactive visualizations_
   d. Better color schemes

**Explanation**: Plotly's main advantage is its interactive capabilities:
- Zoom and pan functionality
- Hover tooltips with data details
- Click events and callbacks
- Dynamic updates
- Web-based sharing
These features make it ideal for:
- Dashboard creation
- Web applications
- Interactive reports
- Data exploration

3. Which plot type is best for visualizing distributions in Seaborn?
   a. lineplot
   b. scatterplot
   _c. distplot_
   d. barplot

**Explanation**: The distplot (now histplot/displot) is ideal for distributions because it:
- Shows the shape of data distribution
- Can overlay kernel density estimation
- Supports rug plots for data points
- Allows easy comparison of distributions
- Provides statistical annotations
It's particularly useful for:
- Understanding data spread
- Identifying outliers
- Checking for normality
- Comparing groups

4. What is a heatmap used for?
   _a. Showing relationships between variables using color intensity_
   b. Displaying temperature data only
   c. Creating 3D visualizations
   d. Animating data changes

**Explanation**: Heatmaps are powerful tools for:
- Visualizing correlation matrices
- Showing patterns in large datasets
- Representing two-dimensional data with color
- Identifying clusters or trends
Key features include:
- Color intensity representing values
- Optional annotations
- Customizable color scales
- Hierarchical clustering options

5. Which Seaborn function creates violin plots?
   _a. sns.violinplot()_
   b. sns.violin()
   c. sns.vplot()
   d. sns.violinshow()

**Explanation**: sns.violinplot() creates violin plots that:
- Combine box plot and kernel density estimation
- Show full distribution of data
- Display quartiles and outliers
- Support categorical comparisons
Benefits include:
- More detailed view than box plots
- Clear visualization of data distribution
- Easy comparison across categories
- Identification of multimodal distributions
