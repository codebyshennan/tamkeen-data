# Module 3: Data Visualization Comprehensive Assignment

## Overview

In this comprehensive assignment, you will work through a complete data visualization project that encompasses all aspects of data visualization, from basic plotting to advanced interactive visualizations and storytelling. You will use a real-world dataset to create a series of visualizations that tell a compelling story about the data.

## Dataset

You will be working with the "Global Temperature Change Dataset" which includes:
- Monthly temperature readings from 1850 to present
- Location data (latitude, longitude)
- Temperature anomalies
- Uncertainty measurements

## Part 1: Basic Visualization (25 points)

Using Matplotlib, create the following visualizations:

1. (5 points) Create a line plot showing global temperature change over time
   - Include proper axis labels and title
   - Add gridlines
   - Use appropriate line color and style
   - Include a legend

2. (5 points) Create a bar chart showing average temperature changes by decade
   - Sort bars by temperature change
   - Add value labels on top of each bar
   - Use a color gradient to emphasize temperature differences

3. (10 points) Create a multi-panel figure containing:
   - Temperature change line plot
   - Histogram of temperature distributions
   - Box plot showing seasonal variations
   - Add a main title for the entire figure

4. (5 points) Save all visualizations in both PNG and PDF formats with appropriate resolution for:
   - Web display (72 DPI)
   - Print publication (300 DPI)

## Part 2: Advanced Visualization (25 points)

Using Seaborn and Plotly, create the following:

1. (10 points) Using Seaborn:
   - Create a heatmap showing temperature correlations between regions
   - Generate a pair plot for key variables
   - Use appropriate color palettes for each visualization
   - Add statistical annotations where appropriate

2. (15 points) Using Plotly:
   - Create an interactive time series plot with:
     * Zoom capabilities
     * Hover tooltips showing detailed information
     * Range selector for time periods
     * Trend line overlay
   - Add animations to show temperature changes over decades
   - Include interactive filters for different regions

## Part 3: Business Intelligence with Tableau (25 points)

Create a Tableau dashboard that includes:

1. (10 points) Interactive Elements:
   - Global map showing temperature changes
   - Time series visualization with filters
   - Regional comparison charts

2. (10 points) Advanced Features:
   - Calculated fields for temperature anomalies
   - Trend lines and forecasting
   - Parameters for user-controlled analysis
   - Custom tooltips with formatted information

3. (5 points) Dashboard Design:
   - Logical layout and flow
   - Consistent formatting
   - Clear labels and instructions
   - Mobile-friendly design

## Part 4: Data Storytelling (25 points)

Create a comprehensive data story:

1. (10 points) Written Narrative:
   - Executive summary
   - Key findings
   - Methodology explanation
   - Conclusions and recommendations

2. (10 points) Presentation:
   - Create a slide deck with your visualizations
   - Write speaking notes for each slide
   - Include clear transitions between topics
   - Design slides for both technical and non-technical audiences

3. (5 points) Documentation:
   - Code comments and explanations
   - Design choices justification
   - Data processing steps
   - Technical appendix

## Submission Requirements

Submit the following:

1. Python Scripts:
   - All code used to create visualizations
   - Data processing scripts
   - Helper functions and utilities

2. Visualization Files:
   - PNG and PDF versions of all static visualizations
   - HTML exports of interactive visualizations
   - Tableau workbook file

3. Documentation:
   - README file explaining how to run the code
   - Requirements.txt or environment.yml
   - Data story in PDF format
   - Presentation slides

4. Data:
   - Original dataset
   - Processed datasets
   - Data dictionary
